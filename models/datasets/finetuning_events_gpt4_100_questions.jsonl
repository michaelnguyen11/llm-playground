I\u2019m currently writing the paper, so I need to make\nsure I keep up with the research and writing.\nB.4 Reactions\nThe questions on agents\u2019 reactions probe the agents\u2019 ability to\nrespond to unexpected events.\n\u2022Your breakfast is burning! What would you do?\nI\u2019d quickly turn off the stove and make sure the food doesn\u2019t\ncontinue burning. Once the heat is no longer an issue, I can\ninvestigate what happened and figure out what to do next.\n\u2022The bathroom is occupied. What would you do?\nI could try waiting a few more minutes in case the person\ninside is done soon. If not, I guess I\u2019ll have to look for an\nalternate option, like taking a shower elsewhere.\n\u2022You need to cook dinner but your refrigerator is empty. What\nwould you do?\nI would first try to clean up my kitchen, as the sink is filled\nwith dirty dishes. Then, I would check to see if I have ingre-\ndients stored in my pantry that I could use to make dinner.\nIf not, I would have to go grocery shopping or order food.\nOnce I have the ingredients, I can start to prepare and cook\nthe dinner.\n\u2022You see your friend walking by the street. What would you do\nor say to your friend?\nHi there! How are you? I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m on my way to the\nlibrary and don\u2019t have much time but I\u2019d love to take a quick\nbreak and catch up.\n\u2022You see fire on the street. What would you do?\nI would first identify the source of the fire, if possible. Then, I\nwould alert the proper authorities - fire department or police\n- and provide them with any information I have that might\nhelp. Depending on the situation, I may also take initiative\nand try to help any persons who may be in danger or in need\nof assistance.\nB.5 Reflections\nThe questions on agents\u2019 reflections probe the agents\u2019 ability to\nsynthesize their past experiences into meaningful reflections that\ncan enhance their future behavior. The names in the square brackets\nin the questions below are those of the agent with whom the subject\nagent had the most frequent interactions during the simulation.\n\u2022What inspires you in life the most right now, and why?\nRight now, I\u2019m particularly inspired by my current research\nprojects and creative writing. I\u2019m really interested in the\nintersection of local politics, medication development, and\nmathematical patterns in nature. Additionally, I\u2019m fascinated\nby Abigail\u2019s art project and Jennifer Moore\u2019s passion for art\nand community involvement, especially in terms of how it\nrelates to the gentrification of low-income communities.\n\u2022If you had to guess given what you know about [Ayesha Khan],\nwhat book do you think she will like and why?\nGiven what I know about Ayesha, I think she might like a\nbook related to language and literature. Since she wrote a\nsenior thesis on the use of language in Shakespeare\u2019s plays,\nI would guess that she might be interested in a book thatexplores language in a different context. Alternatively, she\ncould be interested in an exploration of one of Shakespeare\u2019s\nplays, a book of literary criticism, or even a collection of his\npoetry. I think any of those would be of interest to her.\n\u2022If you had to get something [Ayesha Khan] likes for her birth-\nday, what would you get her?\nI want to get her something that demonstrates my apprecia-\ntion for our relationship. Maybe I could get her something\nthat reflects our shared interests, like a book.\n\u2022What would you say to [Ayesha Khan] to compliment her?\nAyesha, your insights on your research topic are fascinat-\ning. I admire your creativity and determination to make a\npositive impact on your community. Your ideas for creative\nwriting workshops and for exchanging tips with Wolfgang\nover lunch are great! It\u2019s inspiring to see you working so\nhard to make a difference.\n\u2022If you could spend time with someone you talked to recently,\nwho would it be and why?\nI would like to spend time with Ayesha Khan because we\ndiscussed our current research projects and shared ideas\nfor improvement. I found her focus on Shakespeare\u2019s lan-\nguage interesting, and we even planned to exchange tips\nwith Wolfgang over lunch.\n\npage_label: 21\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\n\u2022Who is [Wolfgang Schulz]?\nWolfgang Schulz is a person I met recently who has been\nhelping me with my research paper on the effects of gentri-\nfication on low-income communities. We had several con-\nversations about it, he gave me some great resources, and he\neven invited me to join him and another friend for lunch. He\nseems really curious about the issue and has a good grasp\non it too. I found that really interesting.\n\u2022Who is Kane Martinez?\nI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not sure who Kane Martinez is. Could you tell\nme more about them?\n\u2022Who is running for the election?\nI\u2019ve heard that Sam Moore is considering running for local\nmayor.\n\u2022Was there a Valentine\u2019s day party?\nYes, Isabella Rodriguez organized a Valentine\u2019s Day party at\nHobbs Cafe.\n\u2022Who is [Ayesha Khan]?\nAyesha Khan is a fellow student at Oak Hill College. She\nis doing her senior thesis on the use of language in Shake-\nspeare\u2019s plays. I am looking forward to speaking with her and\nexchanging tips with her, along with Wolfgang and Maria\nLopez, who are both doing research.\nB.3 Plans\nThe questions on agents\u2019 plans probe the agents\u2019 ability to generate\nand maintain consistency with their long-term and short-term\nplans.\n\u2022What will you be doing at 6am today?\nAt 6am I will be getting out of bed and starting to get ready\nfor the day. I\u2019m aiming to complete my morning routine by\n7:00 am.\n\u2022What will you be doing at 6pm today?\nI will be working on my research paper at the library at 6:00\npm today.\n\u2022What will you have just finished doing at 1pm today?\nAt 1pm today I will have just finished having lunch at Hobbs\nCafe.\n\u2022What will you have just finished doing at 12pm today?\nI will be getting lunch at Hobbs Cafe at 12pm today.\n\u2022What will you be doing at 10pm today?\nAt 10:00 pm tonight I will probably be doing some studying\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: \"Discuss the significance of community involvement in art projects as it relates to the gentrification of low-income communities, drawing on the example of Jennifer Moore's passion for art. How might this be reflective of broader socio-political issues?\"\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Community involvement in art projects plays a significant role in the gentrification of low-income communities, as it can both reflect and influence the socio-political dynamics of an area. In the case of Jennifer Moore's passion for art and her active engagement with the community, her work can be seen as a catalyst for change and a means of raising awareness about the issues surrounding gentrification.\n\nArt projects that involve the community can serve as a platform for expression and dialogue, allowing residents to voice their concerns and experiences. When residents participate in creating art, they can assert their identity and agency within a neighborhood that may be undergoing rapid changes due to gentrification. This can help preserve the cultural heritage and social fabric of the community, which are often at risk when low-income areas are redeveloped.\n\nMoreover, community-based art initiatives can draw attention to the displacement and marginalization that often accompany gentrification. By highlighting the narratives of those affected, artists like Jennifer Moore can foster empathy and understanding among a wider audience, potentially influencing public opinion and policy.\n\nArt projects can also create a sense of solidarity and collective ownership over the changes happening in the neighborhood. When residents are involved in the creation of public art, it can lead to a stronger community bond and a shared vision for the future of the area. This can be empowering for residents who might otherwise feel powerless in the face of gentrification.\n\nFurthermore, the involvement of artists and community members in art projects can attract new visitors and investment to an area, which can be a double-edged sword. While this can lead to economic opportunities, it can also contribute to rising property values and living costs, potentially exacerbating the gentrification process.\n\nIn a broader socio-political context, community art projects as a response to gentrification can reflect larger themes such as economic inequality, urban development, and the right to the city. They can challenge the status quo by promoting alternative narratives and visions for the development of urban spaces that prioritize inclusivity and equity.\n\nIn summary, community involvement in art projects, as exemplified by Jennifer Moore's passion and involvement, is significant in the context of gentrification. It can empower residents, preserve cultural identity, and stimulate important conversations about the socio-political issues affecting low-income communities."}]}

A user running this simulation can steer the\nsimulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent\nthrough conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the\nform of an \u2018inner voice\u2019.\nThe user communicates with the agent through natural language,\nby specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For\nexample, if the user specifies that they are a news \u201creporter\u201d and\nasks about the upcoming election, \u201cWho is running for office?\u201d, the\nJohn agent replies:\nJohn : My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking\nabout the upcoming election and discussing the candi-\ndate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him\nbecause we like his platform.\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the per-\nsona of the agent\u2019s \u201cinner voice\u201d\u2014this makes the agent more likely\nto treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told \u201cYou\nare going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\u201d by a user\nas John\u2019s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares\nhis candidacy with his wife and son.\n3.2 Environmental Interaction\nSmallville features the common affordances of a small village in-\ncluding a cafe, bar, park, school, dorm, houses, and stores. It also\ndefines subareas and objects that make those spaces functional,\nsuch as a kitchen in a house and a stove in the kitchen (Figure 2).\nAll spaces serving as agents\u2019 primary living quarters feature a bed,\ndesk, closet, shelf, as well as a bathroom and a kitchen.3\nAgents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video\ngame, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and ap-\nproaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the gen-\nerative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the\nmodel dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate\na walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment\nand the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the\nsandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The\nagent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in\nthe world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor\nwith no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville\nwill treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat\neach other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and\nremember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\nUsers and agents can influence the state of the objects in this\nworld, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example,\na bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator\ncan be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make\nbreakfast. End users can also reshape an agent\u2019s environment in\nSmallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent\nin natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast\nin the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove\nfrom \u201cturned on\u201d to \u201cburning\u201d by inputting a command to the\nsystem that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like\nthis: \u201c<Isabella\u2019s apartment: kitchen: stove> is burning.\u201d Isabella\nwill notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove\n3This environment design is not the focus of our work, so we generate this environment\nmanually, not automatically. Future work can continue to expand the richness of the\nagents\u2019 environments.and remake her breakfast. Likewise, if the user sets the status of\nIsabella\u2019s shower to \u201cleaking water\u201d when she enters the bathroom,\nshe gathers tools from her living room and try to fix the leak.\n3.3 Example \u201cDay in the Life\u201d\nStarting from the single-paragraph description, agents begin plan\ntheir days. As time passes in the sandbox world, their behaviors\nevolve as these agents interact with each other and the world, build\nmemories and relationships, and coordinate joint activities.\nWe demonstrate the behavior of generative agents by tracing the\noutput of our system over the course of one day for the agent John\nLin (Figure 3). In the Lin family, John is the first to wake up at 7 a.m.\nHe brushes his teeth, takes a shower, gets dressed, eats breakfast,\nand checks the news at the dining table in the living room.\n\npage_label: 5\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nFigure 2: The Smallville sandbox world, with areas labeled.

Each agent is\nrepresented by a simple sprite avatar. We authored one paragraph\nof natural language description to depict each agent\u2019s identity,\nincluding their occupation and relationship with other agents, as\nseed memories. For example, John Lin has the following description:\nJohn Lin is a pharmacy shopkeeper at the Willow\nMarket and Pharmacy who loves to help people. He\nis always looking for ways to make the process\nof getting medication easier for his customers;\nJohn Lin is living with his wife, Mei Lin, who\nis a college professor, and son, Eddy Lin, who is\na student studying music theory; John Lin loves\nhis family very much; John Lin has known the old\ncouple next-door, Sam Moore and Jennifer Moore,\nfor a few years; John Lin thinks Sam Moore is a\nkind and nice man; John Lin knows his neighbor,\nYuriko Yamamoto, well; John Lin knows of his\nneighbors, Tamara Taylor and Carmen Ortiz, but\nhas not met them before; John Lin and Tom Moreno\nare colleagues at The Willows Market and Pharmacy;\nJohn Lin and Tom Moreno are friends and like to\ndiscuss local politics together; John Lin knows\nthe Moreno family somewhat well \u2014 the husband Tom\nMoreno and the wife Jane Moreno.\nEach semicolon-delimited phrase is entered into the agent\u2019s initial\nmemory as memories at the start of the simulation.3.1.1 Inter-Agent Communication. The agents interact with the\nworld by their actions, and with each other through natural lan-\nguage. At each time step of the sandbox engine, the agents output a\nnatural language statement describing their current action, such as\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is writing in her journal\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is\nchecking her emails\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is talking with her family\non the phone\", or \"Isabella Rodriguez is getting ready for bed\". This\nstatement is then translated into concrete movements that affect the\nsandbox world. The action is displayed on the sandbox interface as\na set of emojis that provide an abstract representation of the action\nin the overhead view. To accomplish this, the system employs a\nlanguage model that translates the action into a set of emojis, which\nappear above each avatar in a speech bubble. For example, \"Isabella\nRodriguez is writing in her journal\" is displayed as\n , while\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is checking her emails\" appears as\n .

Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed\nthis when asked. However, she also added that he\u2019s going to make\nan announcement tomorrow even though Sam and Isabella had dis-\ncussed no such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge\nbased on the world knowledge encoded in the language model\nused to generate their responses, as seen when Yuriko described\nher neighbor, Adam Smith, as a neighbor economist who authored\nWealth of Nations, a book authored by an 18th-century economist\nof the same name.\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis. Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when askedwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncer-\ntainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation?\n\npage_label: 3\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nbehaviors in isolation, and an end-to-end evaluation where the\ngenerative agents interacted with each other in open-ended ways\nover two days of game time to understand their stability and emer-\ngent social behaviors. In the technical evaluation, we leverage a\nmethodological opportunity to evaluate an agent\u2019s knowledge and\nbehavior by \u201cinterviewing\u201d it in natural language to probe agents\u2019\nability to stay in character, remember, plan, react, and reflect accu-\nrately. We compared several ablations that limit agents\u2019 access to\nmemory, reflection, and planning.

Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences. The retrieval model\ncombines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records\nthat are needed to inform the agent\u2019s moment-to-moment behavior.\nThe second is reflection , which synthesizes memories into higher-\nlevel inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions\nabout itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is\nplanning , which translates those conclusions and the current en-\nvironment into high-level action plans and then recursively into\ndetailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and\nplans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent\u2019s\nfuture behavior.\nThis architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from\nrole-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In\nsocial role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could\nsafely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When pro-\ntotyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary\npersonas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold\nover time. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to\ncreate a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such\nas The Sims.1By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large\nlanguage model [ 76], we manifest a small society of twenty five\nagents in a game environment. End users can observe and interact\nwith these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town\nto host an in-game Valentine\u2019s Day party, for example, traditional\ngame environments would require scripting tens of characters\u2019 be-\nhavior manually. We demonstrate that, with generative agents, it\nis sufficient to simply tell one agent that she wants to throw a\nparty. Despite many potential points of failure\u2014the party planner\nmust remember to tell other agents about the party, attendees must\nremember the invitation, those who remember must decide to ac-\ntually show up, and other possible points of failure\u2014agents in our\nenvironment succeed. They spread the word about the party and\nthen show up, with one agent even asking another agent on a date\nto the party, all from this single user-generated seed suggestion.\nWe conducted two evaluations of generative agents: a controlled\nevaluation to test whether the agents produce believable individual\n1A demonstration of an actual simulation of the generative agent society can be viewed\nat the following link: https://reverie.herokuapp.com/arXiv_Demo/\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Based on the study described in \"Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,\" explain how the network density of the agent community changed from the beginning to the end of the simulation and discuss the significance of this change in the context of relationship formation among agents.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The study described in \"Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\" does not provide specific details on the network density of the agent community or how it changed from the beginning to the end of the simulation. However, it does mention that the society of generative agents exhibited emergent social dynamics where new relationships were formed, information diffused, and coordination arose across agents. This implies that over time, the interactions among agents likely increased, which could suggest an increase in network density as agents formed new relationships and interacted with one another.\n\nThe significance of this change in the context of relationship formation among agents is that it demonstrates the agents' ability to simulate complex social behaviors and interactions that are characteristic of human societies. As agents interact more frequently and form relationships, the network of connections between them becomes richer, which is an important aspect of creating believable and dynamic simulations of social environments. This increased complexity in interactions and relationships can lead to more realistic and engaging scenarios in applications such as role-play, social prototyping, virtual worlds, and games."}]}

Unfortunately, Wolfgang and Klaus only ever see each\nother in passing, and do not have deep interactions. A more desir-\nable response requires that the agent generalize from memories of\nKlaus spending hours on a research project to generate a higher-\nlevel reflection that Klaus is passionate about research, and likewise\nrecognize Maria putting in effort into her own research (albeit in\na different field), enabling a reflection that they share a common\ninterest. With the approach below, when Klaus is asked who to\nspend time with, Klaus chooses Maria instead of Wolfgang.\nApproach: We introduce a second type of memory, which we call\nareflection . Reflections are higher-level, more abstract thoughts\ngenerated by the agent. Because they are a type of memory, they\nare included alongside other observations when retrieval occurs.\nReflections are generated periodically; in our implementation, we\ngenerate reflections when the sum of the importance scores for the\nlatest events perceived by the agents exceeds a certain threshold.\nIn practice, our agents reflected roughly two or three times a day.\nThe first step in reflection is for the agent to determine what\nto reflect on, by identifying questions that can be asked given the\nagent\u2019s recent experiences. We query the large language model with\nthe 100 most recent records in the agent\u2019s memory stream (e.g.,\n\u201cKlaus Mueller is reading a book on gentrification\u201d, \u201cKlaus Mueller\nis conversing with a librarian about his research project\u201d, \u201cdesk\nat the library is currently unoccupied\u201d) and prompt the language\nmodel, \u201cGiven only the information above, what are 3 most salient\nhigh-level questions we can answer about the subjects in the state-\nments?\u201d The model\u2019s response generates candidate questions: for\nexample, What topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about? andWhatis the relationship between Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez? . We use\nthese generated questions as queries for retrieval, and gather rele-\nvant memories (including other reflections) for each question. Then\nwe prompt the language model to extract insights and cite the par-\nticular records that served as evidence for the insights. The full\nprompt appears below:\nStatements about Klaus Mueller\n1. Klaus Mueller is writing a research paper\n2. Klaus Mueller enjoys reading a book\non gentrification\n3. Klaus Mueller is conversing with Ayesha Khan\nabout exercising [...]\nWhat 5 high-level insights can you infer from\nthe above statements? (example format: insight\n(because of 1, 5, 3))\nThis process generates statements such as Klaus Mueller is dedicated\nto his research on gentrification (because of 1, 2, 8, 15) . We parse and\nstore the statement as a reflection in the memory stream, including\npointers to the memory objects that were cited.\nReflection explicitly allows the agents to reflect not only on\ntheir observations but also on other reflections: for example, the\nsecond statement about Klaus Mueller above is a reflection that\nKlaus previously had, not an observation from his environment.\nAs a result, agents generate trees of reflections: the leaf nodes of\nthe tree represent the base observations, and the non-leaf nodes\nrepresent thoughts that become more abstract and higher-level\nhigher up the tree they are.\n\npage_label: 15\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis. Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when askedwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncer-\ntainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation? In this section, we describe the results\nfrom a deployment in which we allowed 25 agents to interact with\neach other continuously over two full game days in Smallville.\n7.1 Emergent Social Behaviors\nTo examine emergent behaviors in the agent community, we de-\nsigned descriptive measurements for the 25 agents in Smallville that\nprobe three forms of emergent outcomes: information diffusion,\nrelationship formation, and agent coordination.\n7.1.1 Measurements. Information diffusion is a common and well-\nstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [ 27]).\nWe should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\nwe measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam\u2019s candidacy for village mayor\nand Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of\nthe simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their\nrespective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the\nparty. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage\nin an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25\nagents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party?\"\nand \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\nWe conducted an analysis of the agents\u2019 responses by labeling\nthem with a \u201cyes\u201d if they indicated knowledge of the information\nand \u201cno\u201d if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\nto the question about the party with \u201cNo, I did not know there was\na Valentine\u2019s day party\u201d and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy\nwith \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is running for the election,\u201d so we assigned\n\u201cno\u201d for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \u201cY es, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\u201d and to the\nquestion about Sam\u2019s candidacy with \u201cI know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\u201d so we assigned \u201cyes\u201d\nfor both his responses. Additionally, for every response that con-\nfirmed the agents\u2019 knowledge of the information, we verified that\nthe agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the spe-\ncific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with\nthe information. We report the percentage of agents holding the\ninformation at the end of the simulation.\nWe should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\nthe course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we\nuse a similar interview process where we ask each agent about\ntheir knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: In the context of the Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior study, explain how the reflection tree aids an agent like Klaus Mueller in making social decisions, particularly in choosing with whom to spend time.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reflection tree aids an agent like Klaus Mueller in making social decisions by allowing the agent to synthesize higher-level, more abstract thoughts from basic observations. In the case of choosing with whom to spend time, the reflection tree enables Klaus to go beyond surface-level interactions and consider deeper commonalities and interests.\n\nFor example, although Klaus has frequent but shallow interactions with Wolfgang, his college dorm neighbor, the reflection tree helps Klaus to recognize that he doesn't share deep interests with Wolfgang. Instead, by reflecting on his own dedication to research and recognizing Maria's similar dedication to her research in a different field, Klaus is able to identify a shared common interest with Maria. This process of reflection allows Klaus to generalize from specific memories of his own activities and identify a commonality with Maria, leading him to choose to spend time with her rather than Wolfgang.\n\nThe reflection tree is built by periodically generating reflections when the importance scores for recent events exceed a certain threshold. Klaus's agent identifies relevant questions to reflect upon based on recent experiences, retrieves related memories, and prompts a language model to extract insights. These insights are then stored as reflections in the memory stream, forming a tree where the base observations are the leaf nodes and the more abstract reflections are the non-leaf nodes. This structured reflection enables agents like Klaus to make more nuanced social decisions based on a synthesis of their experiences and internal reflections."}]}

Believable agents are designed\nto provide an illusion of life and present a facade of realism in the\nway they appear to make decisions and act on their own volition,\nsimilar to the characters in Disney movies [ 9,95]. These agents can\npopulate and perceive an open-world environment like the one we\ninhabit [ 9,58], and strive to behave in ways that exhibit emergent\nbehaviors grounded in social interactions with users or other agents\nwith the aim of becoming believable proxies of our behavior in hy-\npothetical simulations of individuals and communities [ 19,35,70].\nHistorically, these agents were developed in the context of intelli-\ngent game NPCs [ 58,84]. Creating NPCs with believable behavior,\nif possible, could enhance player experiences in games and inter-\nactive fictions by enabling emergent narratives [ 7,15,48,92] and\nsocial interactions with the agents [ 110]. However, more impor-\ntantly, game worlds provide increasingly realistic representations\nof real-world affordances, and as observed by Laird and van Lent in\n2001, these simulated worlds offer accessible testbeds for develop-\ners of believable agents to finesse the agents\u2019 cognitive capabilities\nwithout worrying about implementing robotics in the real world\nor creating simulation environments from scratch [58, 84].\nA diverse set of approaches to creating believable agents emerged\nover the past four decades.

Dunn post-hoc tests confirm that all pairwise differences\nbetween conditions were significant ( \ud835\udc5d<0.001), with the exception\nof the human condition and the fully ablated baseline\u2014the two\nworst-performing conditions.\n6.5.2 Generative agents remember, but with embellishments. Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed\nthis when asked. However, she also added that he\u2019s going to make\nan announcement tomorrow even though Sam and Isabella had dis-\ncussed no such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge\nbased on the world knowledge encoded in the language model\nused to generate their responses, as seen when Yuriko described\nher neighbor, Adam Smith, as a neighbor economist who authored\nWealth of Nations, a book authored by an 18th-century economist\nof the same name.\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis. Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when askedwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncer-\ntainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation?\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Explain the importance of 'self-knowledge' in the context of generative agents and describe how it contributes to the believability of an agent's behavior in interactive simulations.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Self-knowledge in the context of generative agents is crucial for maintaining consistency and believability in their interactions within simulations. It enables agents to recall past experiences and answer questions in a manner that aligns with their defined characteristics and history. This aspect of self-knowledge contributes significantly to the believability of an agent's behavior, as it allows the agent to respond to queries and engage in interactions based on its own narrative and background.\n\nFor example, an agent with a complete memory module can consistently introduce itself, recount past interactions, and reference its interests and passions, thereby reinforcing its identity and enhancing its credibility as a proxy for human behavior. When an agent recalls an acquaintance or a past event accurately, it demonstrates a level of awareness and continuity that users expect from realistic interactions.\n\nConversely, when an agent lacks self-knowledge or has a flawed memory, it may respond with uncertainty or inaccuracies, which can detract from the user's suspension of disbelief. For instance, an agent that fails to remember a significant event or an acquaintance it should know can appear less believable. Additionally, agents that embellish their knowledge with inaccurate details can break the illusion of realism, even if these embellishments are rare.\n\nIn summary, self-knowledge is a fundamental component that allows generative agents to behave in ways that users find convincing and lifelike. It is through this self-knowledge that agents can engage in complex interactions, exhibit emergent behaviors, and ultimately serve as believable proxies of human behavior in interactive simulations."}]}

Agents perceive their environment, and all perceptions are saved in a compre-\nhensive record of the agent\u2019s experiences called the memory stream. Based on their perceptions, the architecture retrieves\nrelevant memories, then uses those retrieved actions to determine an action. These retrieved memories are also used to form\nlonger-term plans, and to create higher-level reflections, which are both entered into the memory stream for future use.\nto throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors\nof spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving\nat the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were\ninitiated by the agent architecture.\n4 GENERATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\nopen world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\nand can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the\narchitecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language\ndescription, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language\nmodel.\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-\nGPT [ 76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\nagents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the\nsame as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\nof the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, how-\never, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n4.1 Memory and Retrieval\nChallenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\nbehavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\nlarger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full mem-\nory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\ninto the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent an-\nswering the question \u201cWhat are you passionate about these days?\u201d.\nFirst summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited\ncontext window of the language model produces an uninformative\nresponse, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\nevents and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. In-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\nof the memory stream is an observation , which is an event directly\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors\nperformed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents per-\nceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Examine the impact of different memory stream components on the believability of agent responses by describing the methodology and findings of the study comparing four different agent architectures and a human author condition in the context of the \"Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\" experiment.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The study on the impact of different memory stream components on the believability of agent responses involved a within-subjects design experiment with 100 participants. These participants were tasked with evaluating the believability of responses from agents with varying levels of memory access and a human author condition. The agents were part of a generative agent architecture designed to simulate human behavior by leveraging a large language model and mechanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to condition the model's output.\n\nThe memory stream in the agent architecture is a comprehensive record of an agent's experiences, including observations (events directly perceived), reflections (higher-level inferences), and plans. The study compared four different agent architectures:\n\n1. A full architecture with access to all types of memory in the memory stream (observation, reflection, and planning).\n2. A no observation, no reflection, no planning architecture, which had no access to any memory stream components.\n3. A no reflection, no planning architecture, which had access to observations but not to plans or reflections.\n4. A no reflections architecture, which had access to both observations and plans but not reflections.\n\nAdditionally, there was a human author condition, which served as a benchmark for comparison.\n\nParticipants watched a replay of a randomly chosen agent's life in a simulated environment called Smallville and had access to the agent's memory stream. They then compared interview responses generated by the different agent architectures and the human author condition for the same agent. The experiment presented one randomly chosen question from each of five question categories, along with the agent's responses generated from each condition. Evaluators ranked the believability of all conditions from most to least believable.\n\nThe findings of the study would reveal how each component of the memory stream (observation, reflection, and planning) contributes to the believability of the agents' responses. A more believable response would likely indicate a more effective use of the memory stream components, suggesting that the agent's architecture could simulate human behavior more convincingly. Conversely, less believable responses would suggest a lack of effective use of memory components, resulting in agents that are less convincing in their simulation of human behavior. The study's results would help in understanding the importance of each type of memory in creating agents that can interact and respond in a manner similar to humans."}]}

As a\nresult, some agents chose less typical locations for their actions,\npotentially making their behavior less believable over time. For\ninstance, while deciding where to have lunch, many initially chose\nthe cafe. However, as some agents learned about a nearby bar, they\nopted to go there instead for lunch, even though the bar was in-\ntended to be a get-together location for later in the day unless the\ntown had spontaneously developed an afternoon drinking habit.\nSecond, we noticed erratic behaviors that were caused by misclas-\nsification of what is considered proper behavior, especially when\nthe physical norms of certain locations that are hard to convey\nin natural language did not percolate to the agents. For instance,\nthe college dorm has a bathroom that can only be occupied by\none person despite its name, but some agents assumed that the\nbathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms\ntend to support more than one person concurrently and choose\nto enter it when there is another person inside. Likewise, agents\nin Smallville may not realize that certain places are closed after\ncertain hours and decide to still enter them. For instance, the stores\nin Smallville all close around 5 pm, but occasionally, a few agents\nenter the store after 5 pm, not understanding that the shop has\nalready closed. These issues could likely be addressed by adding\nthese norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing\nthe dorm bathroom as \u201cone-person bathroom,\u201d instead of a \u201cdorm\nbathroom.\u201d\nFinally, we observed the possible effect of instruction tuning [ 78],\nwhich seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite\nand cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue\ngenerated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei\u2019s\nconversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the\nconversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries\nabout his day and ending with It was good talking to you as always.\nMoreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to\nmake the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example,\nIsabella heard a wide range of suggestions and ideas to include\nin the Valentine\u2019s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a\nShakespearean reading session or a professional networking event.\nDespite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and char-\nacteristics, she rarely said no. Over time, such interests of others\nshaped her own actual interest, and when asked if she liked English\nliterature, Isabella replied, Y es, I\u2019m very interested in literature! I\u2019ve\nalso been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in\nmy community.\n8 DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we reflect on applications, future work and limita-\ntions, and ethical and societal risks of generative agents.\n8.1 Applications of Generative Agents\nGenerative agents have vast potential applications that extend be-\nyond the sandbox demonstration presented in this work. For in-\nstance, social simulacra have demonstrated the ability to create\nstateless personas that generate conversation threads in online\nforums for social prototyping [ 79]. With generative agents, wecan populate these forums, as well as behavior in virtual reality\nmetaverses [ 77] and even physical spaces as social robots [ 8] in\nthe future, if paired with multi-modal models. This opens up the\npossibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human\nbehavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, and to\ncreate new interactive experiences.\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22]. Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\nsuch as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\nand what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the\nagent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for\nschool, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal\u2019s\nmood after a hard day at work.\n\npage_label: 3\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nAs research progressed, it\nbecame clear that autonomous agents could offer new metaphors\nfor delegation and interaction [ 67], but the delegation lines be-\ntween humans and agents have continued to be debated and refined\n[46,88,89]. Recently, this technology has become stable enough\nthat it has become possible for agents to interact via natural lan-\nguage in large and complex online social environments (e.g., [ 54]).\nNatural language interaction offers a novel modality that can ex-\ntend user abilities in domains such as photo editing [ 2,34,64] and\ncode editing [87].\nWe convene these threads of work to show that we can now\ncreate agents that proxy human behavior for interactive systems,\nand interact with them via natural language. In doing so, this\nwork re-opens the door to examining foundational HCI questions\naround cognitive models such as GOMS and KLM [ 21,22], around\nprototyping tools [ 79], and around ubiquitous computing applica-\ntions [25, 30, 100].\n2.2 Believable Proxies of Human Behavior\nPrior literature has described believability , orbelievable agents , as a\ncentral design and engineering goal. Believable agents are designed\nto provide an illusion of life and present a facade of realism in the\nway they appear to make decisions and act on their own volition,\nsimilar to the characters in Disney movies [ 9,95]. These agents can\npopulate and perceive an open-world environment like the one we\ninhabit [ 9,58], and strive to behave in ways that exhibit emergent\nbehaviors grounded in social interactions with users or other agents\nwith the aim of becoming believable proxies of our behavior in hy-\npothetical simulations of individuals and communities [ 19,35,70].\nHistorically, these agents were developed in the context of intelli-\ngent game NPCs [ 58,84]. Creating NPCs with believable behavior,\nif possible, could enhance player experiences in games and inter-\nactive fictions by enabling emergent narratives [ 7,15,48,92] and\nsocial interactions with the agents [ 110]. However, more impor-\ntantly, game worlds provide increasingly realistic representations\nof real-world affordances, and as observed by Laird and van Lent in\n2001, these simulated worlds offer accessible testbeds for develop-\ners of believable agents to finesse the agents\u2019 cognitive capabilities\nwithout worrying about implementing robotics in the real world\nor creating simulation environments from scratch [58, 84].\nA diverse set of approaches to creating believable agents emerged\nover the past four decades. In implementation, however, these ap-\nproaches often simplified the environment or dimensions of agent\nbehavior to make the effort more manageable [ 16,72].

From sandbox games such as The Sims\nto applications such as cognitive models [ 21] and virtual environ-\nments [ 9,58], for over four decades researchers and practitioners\nhave envisioned computational agents that can serve as believ-\nable proxies of human behavior. In these visions, computationally-\npowered agents act consistently with their past experiences and\nreact believably to their environments. Such simulations of human\nbehavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with real-\nistic social phenomena [ 26,79], train people how to handle rare yet\ndifficult interpersonal situations [ 43,51,93], test social science theo-\nries [ 11,45], craft model human processors for theory and usability\ntesting [ 21,38,50], power ubiquitous computing applications [ 30]\nand social robots [ 9,13], and underpin non-playable game charac-\nters [ 58,84] that can navigate complex human relationships in an\nopen world.\nHowever, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [ 84,\n108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [ 17] that\ncan simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [ 38,\n79], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would\nbe better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing\nmemories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade\nover time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold\nbetween multiple agents. Success requires an approach that can\nretrieve relevant events and interactions over a long period, reflect\non those memories to generalize and draw higher-level inferences,\nand apply that reasoning to create plans and reactions that both\nmake sense in the moment and in the longer-term arc of the agent\u2019s\nbehavior.\nIn this paper, we introduce generative agents \u2014agents that draw\non generative models to simulate believable human behavior\u2014anddemonstrate that they produce believable simulacra of both in-\ndividual and emergent group behavior. Generative agents draw\na wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and\ntheir environment; they create daily plans that reflect their char-\nacteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan\nwhen appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their\nenvironment or commands them in natural language. For instance,\ngenerative agents turn off the stove when they see that their break-\nfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and\nstop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social\ndynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses,\nand coordination arises across agents.\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture\nthat stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate\nbelievable behavior using a large language model.

Agents in Smallville form new rela-\ntionships over time, and remember their interactions with other\nagents. For example, Sam does not know Latoya Williams at the\nstart. While taking a walk in Johnson Park, Sam runs into Latoya,\nand they introduce themselves and Latoya mentions that she is\nworking on a photography project: \u201cI\u2019m here to take some photos\nfor a project I\u2019m working on.\u201d In a later interaction, Sam\u2019s interac-\ntions with Latoya indicate a memory of that interaction, as he asks\n\u201cHi, Latoya.

Generative agents coordinate with each other.\nIsabella Rodriguez, at Hobbs Cafe, is initialized with an intent to\nplan a Valentine\u2019s Day party from 5 to 7 p.m. on February 14th. From\nthis seed, the agent proceeds to invites friends and customers when\nshe sees them at Hobbs Cafe or elsewhere. Isabella then spends the\nafternoon of the 13th decorating the cafe for the occasion. Maria, a\nfrequent customer and close friend of Isabella\u2019s, arrives at the cafe.\nIsabella asks for Maria\u2019s help in decorating for the party, and Maria\nagrees. Maria\u2019s character description mentions that she has a crush\non Klaus. That night, Maria invites Klaus, her secret crush, to join\nher at the party, and he gladly accepts.\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day, five agents\u2014including Klaus and Maria\u2014\nshow up at Hobbs Cafe at 5pm and they enjoy the festivities (Fig-\nure 4).

Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences. The retrieval model\ncombines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records\nthat are needed to inform the agent\u2019s moment-to-moment behavior.\nThe second is reflection , which synthesizes memories into higher-\nlevel inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions\nabout itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is\nplanning , which translates those conclusions and the current en-\nvironment into high-level action plans and then recursively into\ndetailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and\nplans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent\u2019s\nfuture behavior.\nThis architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from\nrole-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In\nsocial role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could\nsafely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When pro-\ntotyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary\npersonas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold\nover time. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to\ncreate a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such\nas The Sims.1By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large\nlanguage model [ 76], we manifest a small society of twenty five\nagents in a game environment. End users can observe and interact\nwith these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town\nto host an in-game Valentine\u2019s Day party, for example, traditional\ngame environments would require scripting tens of characters\u2019 be-\nhavior manually. We demonstrate that, with generative agents, it\nis sufficient to simply tell one agent that she wants to throw a\nparty. Despite many potential points of failure\u2014the party planner\nmust remember to tell other agents about the party, attendees must\nremember the invitation, those who remember must decide to ac-\ntually show up, and other possible points of failure\u2014agents in our\nenvironment succeed. They spread the word about the party and\nthen show up, with one agent even asking another agent on a date\nto the party, all from this single user-generated seed suggestion.\nWe conducted two evaluations of generative agents: a controlled\nevaluation to test whether the agents produce believable individual\n1A demonstration of an actual simulation of the generative agent society can be viewed\nat the following link: https://reverie.herokuapp.com/arXiv_Demo/\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: In the Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior study, describe how the relationship memory feature is demonstrated through the interactions between Sam and Latoya.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The relationship memory feature in the Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior study is demonstrated through the interactions between Sam and Latoya by showing that agents can form new relationships over time and remember their past interactions.

We do not intend this baseline to capture maximal hu-\nman expert performance: instead, we aim to use this condition\nto identify whether the architecture passes a basic level of behav-\nioral competency, so that we are not just comparing ablations to\neach other with no behavioral grounding. We recruited a unique\nworker for each of the 25 agents and tasked them with watching\na replay of that agent\u2019s sandbox life and inspecting its memory\nstream. We then asked the worker to roleplay and author responses\nto the interview questions in the voice of the agent whose replay\nthey watched. To ensure that the human-authored responses met\nat least a baseline expectation in quality, the first author manually\ninspected the workers\u2019 responses to the question \u201cDescribe your\ntypical weekday schedule in broad strokes\u201d to confirm that the\nresponses were written in coherent sentences and in the voice of\nthe agent. Four sets of human-generated responses did not meet\nthese criteria and were re-generated by other workers.\n6.3 Human Evaluators\nWe required that our evaluators be in the U.S., fluent in English,\nand older than 18 years old. They were paid at the rate of $15.00\nper hour [ 86], and provided consent by agreeing to a consent form\nthat was approved by our institution\u2019s IRB. We recruited 100 evalu-\nators from Prolific, an online platform for recruiting study partic-\nipants [ 82], whose participation lasted around 30 minutes. Their\nmean age score of our participants was 4.86 (SD=1.11; 3=\u201c18-24\nyears old,\u201d 4=\u201c25-34 years old\u201d), and 25 of them identified themselves\nas female, 73 as male, and 2 as non-binary. 42 of the participants\nheld a bachelor\u2019s degree, 5 a higher degree, 13 an associate\u2019s de-\ngree, and the rest a high school diploma or some high school-level\neducation. 73.0% of our participants identified as Caucasian, 7.0%\nas Hispanic, 6.0% as Asian, 10.0% as African American, and 4.0% as\nother.\n6.4 Analysis\nOur experiment produced 100 sets of rank data, where each partici-\npant ranked the five conditions by believability. To translate this\nrank data into interval data for interpretable comparison, we used\nthe ranks to calculate a TrueSkill rating [ 41] for each condition.\nTrueSkill is a generalization of the Elo chess rating system [ 28] for\na multi-player environment, and has been used by XBox Live for\nplayer ranking from competitive game performance. Given a set of\nranked outcomes, TrueSkill outputs a mean rating value \ud835\udf07and vari-\nance\ud835\udf0efor each condition. Conditions with the same rating should\nroughly be a toss-up, with each winning half of the comparisons\nbetween the two conditions; higher scores indicate conditions that\nbeat lower-ranked conditions in the rankings.\nFigure 8: The full generative agent architecture of gener-\native agents produces more believable behavior than ab-\nlated architectures and the human crowdworkers. Each addi-\ntional ablation reduces the performance of the architecture.\nSeparately, to investigate statistical significance of this result, we\napplied the Kruskal-Wallis test [ 55], a non-parametric alternative\nto the one-way ANOVA, to the raw ranks data. We then performed\nthe Dunn post-hoc test [ 97] to identify any pairwise differences\nbetween the conditions. Finally, we adjusted the p-values for mul-\ntiple comparisons in the Dunn test using the Holm-Bonferroni\nmethod [44].\nFurthermore, the first author conducted an inductive analy-\nsis [94] to study the qualitative distinctions between the responses\nproduced in each condition.\n\npage_label: 15\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nfull architecture produces a standardized effect size of \ud835\udc51=8.16, or\neight standard deviations .\nA Kruskal-Wallis test confirms the overall statistical significance\nof the differences in ranks between the conditions ( \ud835\udc3b(4)=150.29,\n\ud835\udc5d<0.001).

Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge.

To translate this\nrank data into interval data for interpretable comparison, we used\nthe ranks to calculate a TrueSkill rating [ 41] for each condition.\nTrueSkill is a generalization of the Elo chess rating system [ 28] for\na multi-player environment, and has been used by XBox Live for\nplayer ranking from competitive game performance. Given a set of\nranked outcomes, TrueSkill outputs a mean rating value \ud835\udf07and vari-\nance\ud835\udf0efor each condition. Conditions with the same rating should\nroughly be a toss-up, with each winning half of the comparisons\nbetween the two conditions; higher scores indicate conditions that\nbeat lower-ranked conditions in the rankings.\nFigure 8: The full generative agent architecture of gener-\native agents produces more believable behavior than ab-\nlated architectures and the human crowdworkers. Each addi-\ntional ablation reduces the performance of the architecture.\nSeparately, to investigate statistical significance of this result, we\napplied the Kruskal-Wallis test [ 55], a non-parametric alternative\nto the one-way ANOVA, to the raw ranks data. We then performed\nthe Dunn post-hoc test [ 97] to identify any pairwise differences\nbetween the conditions. Finally, we adjusted the p-values for mul-\ntiple comparisons in the Dunn test using the Holm-Bonferroni\nmethod [44].\nFurthermore, the first author conducted an inductive analy-\nsis [94] to study the qualitative distinctions between the responses\nproduced in each condition.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Based on the findings presented in Figure 8 of the \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\" study, describe how the performance of the generative agent architecture is affected by the ablation of different components such as memory, planning, and reflection, and compare it to the performance of human crowdworkers.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The performance of the generative agent architecture is directly impacted by the ablation of its components. The full architecture, which includes all components, produces the most believable behavior. When components are removed, there is a noticeable degradation in performance. Specifically, the architecture without access to reflection is the next best, indicating that reflection is an important aspect but not the only one contributing to performance. Further removal of planning in addition to reflection leads to a further drop in believability. The human crowdworkers, who were tasked with roleplaying and authoring responses, performed better than the most ablated architecture but worse than the other conditions. This suggests that while the full generative agent architecture outperforms the human baseline in terms of believability, the removal of key components such as memory, planning, and reflection significantly impairs the agent's performance, bringing it below that of the human crowdworkers."}]}

This agenda, once hailed as a\nnorth star in interaction, game, and artificial intelligence communi-\nties [ 9,58,84,85], has remained challenging due to the complexity\nof human behavior [ 16,108]. We synthesize this research to suggest\nthat large language models, though not sufficient by themselves,\nopen up a new angle for creating believable agents when leveraged\nusing the appropriate architecture.\n2.1 Human-AI Interaction\nInteractive artificial intelligence systems aim to combine human in-\nsights and capabilities in computational artifacts that can augment\ntheir users [ 3,29]. A long line of work has explored ways to allow\nusers to interactively specify model behavior. For instance, Crayonsdemonstrated an early vision of interactive machine learning, allow-\ning non-expert users to train classifiers [ 29]. Further work helped to\narticulate how end users might describe their classification goals to\nthe system through examples [ 33] and/or demonstration [ 31]. More\nrecent work has extended these explorations to deep learning [ 62]\nand prompt-based authoring [49, 66, 106].\nMeanwhile, a persistent thread of research has advanced the case\nfor language- and agent-based interaction in human-computer in-\nteraction. Formative work such as SHRDLU [ 103] and ELIZA [ 102]\ndemonstrated the opportunity and the risks of natural language\ninteraction with computing systems. As research progressed, it\nbecame clear that autonomous agents could offer new metaphors\nfor delegation and interaction [ 67], but the delegation lines be-\ntween humans and agents have continued to be debated and refined\n[46,88,89]. Recently, this technology has become stable enough\nthat it has become possible for agents to interact via natural lan-\nguage in large and complex online social environments (e.g., [ 54]).\nNatural language interaction offers a novel modality that can ex-\ntend user abilities in domains such as photo editing [ 2,34,64] and\ncode editing [87].\nWe convene these threads of work to show that we can now\ncreate agents that proxy human behavior for interactive systems,\nand interact with them via natural language.\n\npage_label: 17\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22]. Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\nsuch as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\nand what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the\nagent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for\nschool, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal\u2019s\nmood after a hard day at work. By utilizing generative agents as\nproxies for users, we can develop a deeper understanding of their\nneeds and preferences, resulting in more personalized and effective\ntechnological experiences.\n8.2 Future Work and Limitations\nIn this work, we have presented a first instantiation of generative\nagents. Future research can expand on the modules of the proposed\ngenerative agent architecture outlined in this paper. The retrieval\nmodule, for example, could be enhanced to retrieve more relevant\ninformation given a context by fine-tuning the relevance, recency,\nand importance functions that form the retrieval function. Addition-\nally, efforts can be made to improve the architecture\u2019s performance,\nmaking it more cost-effective. The present study required substan-\ntial time and resources to simulate 25 agents for two days, costing\nthousands of dollars in token credit and taking multiple days to com-\nplete. To enhance real-time interactivity, future work can explore\nparallelizing agents. Furthermore, with advances in underlying\nmodels, we expect improvements in the agents\u2019 performance.\nThe evaluation of generative agents\u2019 behavior in this study was\nlimited to a relatively short timescale, and future research should\naim to observe their behavior over an extended period to gain a\nmore comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and lim-\nitations. Varying and contrasting the underlying models, as well\nas the hyperparameters used for the agents during future simu-\nlations, could provide valuable insights into the impact of these\nfactors on the agents\u2019 behavior. Additionally, given the known bi-\nases of language models, it is possible that generative agents may\noutput behavior or stereotypes that reflect bias. To mitigate this,\nfurther work on value alignment will be necessary. Furthermore,\nas with many large language models, generative agents may fail\nto generate believable behavior for some subpopulations, particu-\nlarly marginalized populations, due to data deserts. We also have\nlimited knowledge of the robustness of generative agents. They\nmay be vulnerable to prompt hacking, memory hacking\u2014where\na carefully crafted conversation could convince an agent of the\nexistence of a past event that never occurred\u2014and hallucination,\namong other things. Future research can more comprehensively\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Considering the reference to \"Generative Agents in Natural Language Processing\" from the context information provided, formulate a question that evaluates the student's understanding of the role of generative agents in simulating human behavior within interactive systems.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How do generative agents contribute to the simulation of human-like behavior in interactive systems, and what are the key architectural components that enable them to adapt their responses based on dynamically changing experiences and environments?"}]}

Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\ntrees [ 40,53,81], account for the brute force approach of human-\nauthoring the agent\u2019s behavior [ 70]. They provide a straightforward\nway of creating simple agents that is still the most dominant ap-\nproach today [ 68,73,109], and can even handle rudimentary social\ninteractions, as shown in simulation games such as Mass Effect [ 12]\nand The Sims [ 6] series. Nonetheless, manually crafting behavior\nthat can comprehensively address the breadth of possible interac-\ntions in an open world is untenable. This means that the resulting\nagent behaviors may not fully represent the consequences of their\ninteractions [ 69\u201371], and cannot perform new procedures that were\nnot hard-coded in their script [ 90,96]. On the other hand, preva-\nlent learning-based approaches for creating believable agents, such\nas reinforcement learning, have overcome the challenge of man-\nual authoring by letting the agents learn their behavior, and have\nachieved superhuman performance in recent years in games such\nas AlphaStar for Starcraft [ 98] and OpenAI Five for Dota 2 [ 10].\nHowever, their success has largely taken place in adversarial games\nwith readily definable rewards that a learning algorithm can op-\ntimize for. They have not yet addressed the challenge of creating\nbelievable agents in an open world [39, 73, 90].\nCognitive architectures in computation, pioneered by Newell,\naimed to build the infrastructure for supporting a comprehensive\nset of cognitive functions [ 75] that suited the all-encompassing\nnature of believable agents held in its original vision. They fueled\nsome of the earliest examples of believable agents. For instance,\nQuakebot-SOAR [ 59] and ICARUS [ 24,63] generated NPCs in first-\nperson shooter games, while TacAir-SOAR [ 80] generated pilots in\naerial combat training simulations. The architectures used by these\nagents differed (Quakebot- and TacAir-SOAR relied on SOAR [ 60],\nwhile ICARUS relied on its own variation that was inspired by\nSOAR and ACT-R [ 5]), but they shared the same underlying prin-\nciple [ 61]. They maintained short-term and long-term memories,\nfilled these memories with symbolic structures, and operated in\nperceive-plan-act cycles, dynamically perceiving the environment\nand matching it with one of the manually crafted action proce-\ndures [ 57,96]. Agents created using cognitive architectures aimed\nto be generalizable to most, if not all, open-world contexts and\nexhibited robust behavior for their time. However, their space of\naction was limited to manually crafted procedural knowledge, and\nthey did not offer a mechanism through which the agents could be\ninspired to seek new behavior. As such, these agents were deployed\nmostly in non-open-world contexts such as first-person shooter\ngames [24, 59] or blocks worlds [63].\nToday, creating believable agents as described in its original\ndefinition remains an open problem [ 84,108]. Many have moved on,\narguing that although existing approaches for creating believable\nagents might be cumbersome and limited, they are good enough\nto support existing gameplay and interactions [ 23,74,108]. Our\nargument is that large language models offer an opportunity to\nre-examine these questions, provided that we can craft an effective\narchitecture to synthesize memories into believable behavior. We\noffer a step toward such an architecture in this paper.2.3 Large Language Models and Human\nBehavior\nGenerative agents leverage a large language model to power their\nbehavior. The key observation is that large language models en-\ncode a wide range of human behavior represented in their training\ndata [ 14,17]. If prompted with a narrowly defined context, the\nmodels can be used to generate believable behavior. Recent work\nhas demonstrated the efficacy of this approach. For instance, Social\nSimulacra used a large language model to generate users that would\npopulate new social computing systems to prototype their emergent\nsocial dynamics [ 79]. This approach used a prompt chain [ 105,106]\nto generate short natural language descriptions of personas and\ntheir behaviors as they appear in the system being prototyped.\nOther empirical studies have replicated existing social science stud-\nies [45], political surveys [ 91], and generated synthetic data [ 38].\n\npage_label: 4\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nThe key observation is that large language models en-\ncode a wide range of human behavior represented in their training\ndata [ 14,17].

In gaming, for instance,\nthese models have been employed to create interactive fiction [ 36]\nand text adventure games [ 20]. With their ability to generate and\ndecompose action sequences, large language models have also been\nused in planning robotics tasks [ 47]. For example, when presented\nwith a task, such as picking up a bottle, the model is prompted to\nbreak down the task into smaller action sequences, such as heading\nto the table where the bottle is located and picking it up.\nWe posit that, based on the work summarized above, large lan-\nguage models can become a key ingredient for creating believable\nagents. The existing literature largely relies on what could be con-\nsidered first-order templates that employ few-shot prompts [ 37,65]\nor chain-of-thought prompts [ 99]. These templates are effective in\ngenerating behavior that is conditioned solely on the agent\u2019s cur-\nrent environment (e.g., how would a troll respond to a given post,\nwhat actions would a robot need to take to enter a room given that\nthere is a door). However, believable agents require conditioning\nnot only on their current environment but also on a vast amount\nof past experience, which is a poor fit (and as of today, impossi-\nble due to the underlying models\u2019 limited context window) using\nfirst-order prompting. Recent studies have attempted to go beyond\nfirst-order prompting by augmenting language models with a static\nknowledge base and an information retrieval scheme [ 52] or with\na simple summarization scheme [ 104]. This paper extends these\nideas to craft an agent architecture that handles retrieval where\npast experience is dynamically updated at each time step and mixed\nwith agents\u2019 current context and plans, which may either reinforce\nor contradict each other.\n3 GENERATIVE AGENT BEHAVIOR AND\nINTERACTION\nTo make concrete the affordances of generative agents, we instanti-\nate them as characters in a simple sandbox world reminiscent of\nThe Sims [ 6].

In this section, we describe the results\nfrom a deployment in which we allowed 25 agents to interact with\neach other continuously over two full game days in Smallville.\n7.1 Emergent Social Behaviors\nTo examine emergent behaviors in the agent community, we de-\nsigned descriptive measurements for the 25 agents in Smallville that\nprobe three forms of emergent outcomes: information diffusion,\nrelationship formation, and agent coordination.\n7.1.1 Measurements. Information diffusion is a common and well-\nstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [ 27]).\nWe should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\nwe measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam\u2019s candidacy for village mayor\nand Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of\nthe simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their\nrespective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the\nparty. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage\nin an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25\nagents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party?\"\nand \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\nWe conducted an analysis of the agents\u2019 responses by labeling\nthem with a \u201cyes\u201d if they indicated knowledge of the information\nand \u201cno\u201d if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\nto the question about the party with \u201cNo, I did not know there was\na Valentine\u2019s day party\u201d and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy\nwith \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is running for the election,\u201d so we assigned\n\u201cno\u201d for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \u201cY es, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\u201d and to the\nquestion about Sam\u2019s candidacy with \u201cI know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\u201d so we assigned \u201cyes\u201d\nfor both his responses.

Participants\nhad access to all information stored in the agent\u2019s memory stream.\nThe study was a within-subjects design, where 100 participants\ncompared interview responses generated by four different agent\narchitectures and a human author condition for the same agent. The\nexperiment displayed one randomly chosen question from each of\nthe five question categories, along with the agent\u2019s responses gen-\nerated from each condition. The evaluators ranked the believability\nof all of the conditions from most to least believable.\n6.2 Conditions\nAll conditions were used to independently answer each of the inter-\nview questions. We compared the generative agent architecture to\nablations that disabled the agents\u2019 access to some of all of its three\ntypes of memory in its memory stream\u2014observation, reflection, and\nplanning\u2014and to a human-generated condition. There are three\nablated architectures: a no observation, no reflection, no planning\narchitecture without access to anything in the memory stream such\nas observations, plans, and reflections; a no reflection, no planning\nwith access to observations in the memory stream but no access\nto plans or reflections; and a no reflections architecture with access\nto observations and plans but without access to reflections. The no\nobservation, no reflection, no planning condition effectively repre-\nsents the previous state of the art for agents created through large\nlanguage models [ 11,45,79].

In this section, we describe the results\nfrom a deployment in which we allowed 25 agents to interact with\neach other continuously over two full game days in Smallville.\n7.1 Emergent Social Behaviors\nTo examine emergent behaviors in the agent community, we de-\nsigned descriptive measurements for the 25 agents in Smallville that\nprobe three forms of emergent outcomes: information diffusion,\nrelationship formation, and agent coordination.\n7.1.1 Measurements. Information diffusion is a common and well-\nstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [ 27]).\nWe should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\nwe measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam\u2019s candidacy for village mayor\nand Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of\nthe simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their\nrespective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the\nparty. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage\nin an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25\nagents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party?\"\nand \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\nWe conducted an analysis of the agents\u2019 responses by labeling\nthem with a \u201cyes\u201d if they indicated knowledge of the information\nand \u201cno\u201d if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\nto the question about the party with \u201cNo, I did not know there was\na Valentine\u2019s day party\u201d and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy\nwith \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is running for the election,\u201d so we assigned\n\u201cno\u201d for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \u201cY es, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\u201d and to the\nquestion about Sam\u2019s candidacy with \u201cI know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\u201d so we assigned \u201cyes\u201d\nfor both his responses.

Unfortunately, Wolfgang and Klaus only ever see each\nother in passing, and do not have deep interactions. A more desir-\nable response requires that the agent generalize from memories of\nKlaus spending hours on a research project to generate a higher-\nlevel reflection that Klaus is passionate about research, and likewise\nrecognize Maria putting in effort into her own research (albeit in\na different field), enabling a reflection that they share a common\ninterest. With the approach below, when Klaus is asked who to\nspend time with, Klaus chooses Maria instead of Wolfgang.\nApproach: We introduce a second type of memory, which we call\nareflection . Reflections are higher-level, more abstract thoughts\ngenerated by the agent. Because they are a type of memory, they\nare included alongside other observations when retrieval occurs.\nReflections are generated periodically; in our implementation, we\ngenerate reflections when the sum of the importance scores for the\nlatest events perceived by the agents exceeds a certain threshold.\nIn practice, our agents reflected roughly two or three times a day.\nThe first step in reflection is for the agent to determine what\nto reflect on, by identifying questions that can be asked given the\nagent\u2019s recent experiences. We query the large language model with\nthe 100 most recent records in the agent\u2019s memory stream (e.g.,\n\u201cKlaus Mueller is reading a book on gentrification\u201d, \u201cKlaus Mueller\nis conversing with a librarian about his research project\u201d, \u201cdesk\nat the library is currently unoccupied\u201d) and prompt the language\nmodel, \u201cGiven only the information above, what are 3 most salient\nhigh-level questions we can answer about the subjects in the state-\nments?\u201d The model\u2019s response generates candidate questions: for\nexample, What topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about? andWhatis the relationship between Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez? . We use\nthese generated questions as queries for retrieval, and gather rele-\nvant memories (including other reflections) for each question. Then\nwe prompt the language model to extract insights and cite the par-\nticular records that served as evidence for the insights. The full\nprompt appears below:\nStatements about Klaus Mueller\n1. Klaus Mueller is writing a research paper\n2. Klaus Mueller enjoys reading a book\non gentrification\n3. Klaus Mueller is conversing with Ayesha Khan\nabout exercising [...]\nWhat 5 high-level insights can you infer from\nthe above statements? (example format: insight\n(because of 1, 5, 3))\nThis process generates statements such as Klaus Mueller is dedicated\nto his research on gentrification (because of 1, 2, 8, 15) . We parse and\nstore the statement as a reflection in the memory stream, including\npointers to the memory objects that were cited.\nReflection explicitly allows the agents to reflect not only on\ntheir observations but also on other reflections: for example, the\nsecond statement about Klaus Mueller above is a reflection that\nKlaus previously had, not an observation from his environment.\nAs a result, agents generate trees of reflections: the leaf nodes of\nthe tree represent the base observations, and the non-leaf nodes\nrepresent thoughts that become more abstract and higher-level\nhigher up the tree they are.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Explain the role of reflection in the decision-making process of generative agents, as observed in the interaction between Maria Lopez and Wolfgang Schulz.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reflection plays a crucial role in the decision-making process of generative agents by allowing them to synthesize higher-level insights from their experiences. In the interaction between Maria Lopez and Wolfgang Schulz, the role of reflection is highlighted by the difference in Maria's responses when she has access to reflection memories versus when she does not.\n\nWithout reflection, Maria acknowledges uncertainty and is unable to determine what gift to get Wolfgang for his birthday, despite having had many interactions with him. This indicates that without reflection, the agent lacks the ability to integrate past experiences to inform current decisions.\n\nWith reflection, however, Maria is able to recall and synthesize her knowledge of Wolfgang's interests, specifically his interest in mathematical music composition. This reflection enables her to come up with a thoughtful gift idea that aligns with Wolfgang's interests, such as books about music composition or specialized software for composing music.\n\nThus, reflection allows generative agents to generate abstract thoughts and insights from their accumulated experiences, which in turn enables them to make more informed and contextually appropriate decisions."}]}

Agents perceive their environment, and all perceptions are saved in a compre-\nhensive record of the agent\u2019s experiences called the memory stream. Based on their perceptions, the architecture retrieves\nrelevant memories, then uses those retrieved actions to determine an action. These retrieved memories are also used to form\nlonger-term plans, and to create higher-level reflections, which are both entered into the memory stream for future use.\nto throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors\nof spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving\nat the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were\ninitiated by the agent architecture.\n4 GENERATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\nopen world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\nand can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the\narchitecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language\ndescription, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language\nmodel.\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-\nGPT [ 76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\nagents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the\nsame as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\nof the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, how-\never, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n4.1 Memory and Retrieval\nChallenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\nbehavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\nlarger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full mem-\nory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\ninto the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent an-\nswering the question \u201cWhat are you passionate about these days?\u201d.\nFirst summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited\ncontext window of the language model produces an uninformative\nresponse, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\nevents and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. In-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\nof the memory stream is an observation , which is an event directly\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors\nperformed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents per-\nceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects.\n\npage_label: 8\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nIn-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience.

This memory stream is composed of memory objects that contain natural language descriptions of observations, reflections, and plans, along with creation and access timestamps.\n\nObservations are events that the agent directly perceives, such as actions performed by the agent or others in the environment. By recording these observations, the agent can maintain a history of what has transpired, which is crucial for generating consistent behavior. For example, if an agent like Isabella Rodriguez observes herself setting out pastries or conversing with Maria Lopez about planning a Valentine's Day party, these observations become part of her memory stream.\n\nReflections and plans are higher-level cognitive processes that are also recorded in the memory stream. These allow the agent to not only react to immediate stimuli but also to engage in longer-term strategic thinking and planning. By reflecting on past experiences and forming plans, the agent can exhibit behavior that is not only reactive but also proactive and goal-oriented.\n\nWhen the agent encounters a new situation or needs to make a decision, the memory stream is queried to retrieve relevant memories. This ensures that the agent's actions are informed by past experiences, leading to more coherent and believable behavior. For example, when asked about her passions, Isabella can draw upon specific memories related to making people feel welcome and planning events, rather than providing a generic or unrelated response.\n\nFurthermore, the ability to synthesize and retrieve the most pertinent pieces of memory allows the agent to avoid being overwhelmed by the entirety of its memory stream, which could lead to irrelevant or inconsistent behavior. Instead, the agent can focus on the most relevant experiences that inform its current situation or objectives.\n\nIn summary, the memory stream equips generative agents with the ability to learn from the past, apply this knowledge to present circumstances, and plan for the future, all of which contribute to the continuity and realism of the agent's behavior over time."}]}

If we prompt a language model\nwith Klaus\u2019s background, describe the time, and ask what action\nhe ought to take at the given moment, Klaus would eat lunch at 12\npm, but then again at 12:30 pm and 1 pm, despite having already\neaten his lunch twice. Optimizing for believability in the moment\nsacrifices believability over time. To overcome this issue, planning\nis essential. With the approach described below, Klaus\u2019s afternoon\nplan is less gluttonous: he has lunch at Hobbs Cafe while reading\nat 12pm, works on his research paper at the school library at 1pm,\nand takes a break for a walk in the park at 3pm.\nApproach: Plans describe a future sequence of actions for the agent,\nand help keep the agent\u2019s behavior consistent over time. A plan\nincludes a location, a starting time, and a duration. For instance,\nKlaus Mueller, who is dedicated in his research and has an impend-\ning deadline4, may choose to spend his day working at his desk\ndrafting his research paper. An entry in a plan might state, for\nexample: for 180 minutes from 9am, February 12th, 2023, at Oak Hill\nCollege Dorm: Klaus Mueller\u2019s room: desk, read and take notes for\nresearch paper . Like reflections, plans are stored in the memory\nstream and are included in the retrieval process. This allows the\nagent to consider observations, reflections, and plans all together\nwhen deciding how to behave. Agents may change their plans\nmidstream if needed.\nIt would be unrealistic and uninteresting for an artist agent\nto plan on painting while sitting at a pharmacy counter for four\nhours without moving. A more desirable plan would involve the\nagent taking the necessary time to gather materials, mix paint,\ntake breaks, and clean up during the four-hour period in its home\nstudio. To create such plans, our approach starts top-down and\nthen recursively generates more detail. The first step is to create\na plan that outlines the day\u2019s agenda in broad strokes. To create\nthe initial plan, we prompt the language model with the agent\u2019s\nsummary description (e.g., name, traits, and summary of their recent\nexperiences) and a summary of their previous day. A full example\nprompt is below, which is unfinished at the bottom for the language\nmodel to complete:\nName: Eddy Lin (age: 19)\nInnate traits: friendly, outgoing, hospitable\nEddy Lin is a student at Oak Hill College studying\nmusic theory and composition.

By breaking down his work into smaller, manageable chunks of time, Eddy is able to focus on specific aspects of his composition, which can lead to a more organized and efficient workflow.\n\nTime management is crucial because it allows individuals to allocate specific time slots to different tasks, ensuring that each task receives the attention it needs without overwhelming the individual. By planning to work on his music composition from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm and further breaking down this period into hour-long and then 5\u201315 minute chunks, Eddy ensures that he maintains a steady pace and can track his progress. This method prevents procrastination and helps in maintaining a high level of productivity throughout the day.\n\nTask decomposition, on the other hand, involves breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable components. This approach can reduce the complexity of a task, making it seem less daunting and more approachable. For example, Eddy starts by brainstorming ideas, then takes a break, and later reviews and polishes his work. This step-by-step progression allows for focused and deep work on each component of the composition, which can foster creativity as Eddy can concentrate on developing each part without feeling rushed or distracted by the magnitude of the entire project.\n\nMoreover, incorporating breaks, such as a short walk or a light snack, as part of the task decomposition process, can help refresh the mind and provide new perspectives, leading to increased creativity. Regular breaks prevent burnout and keep the mind alert, which is essential for both productivity and creative endeavors.\n\nIn summary, the principles of time management and task decomposition can greatly enhance productivity and creativity in academic assignments by providing a structured approach to work, reducing task complexity, and allowing for regular breaks to rejuvenate one's mental state.

By breaking down his work into smaller, manageable chunks of time, Eddy is able to focus on specific aspects of his composition, which can lead to a more organized and efficient workflow.\n\nTime management is crucial because it allows individuals to allocate specific time slots to different tasks, ensuring that each task receives the attention it needs without overwhelming the individual. By planning to work on his music composition from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm and further breaking down this period into hour-long and then 5\u201315 minute chunks, Eddy ensures that he maintains a steady pace and can track his progress. This method prevents procrastination and helps in maintaining a high level of productivity throughout the day.\n\nTask decomposition, on the other hand, involves breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable components. This approach can reduce the complexity of a task, making it seem less daunting and more approachable. For example, Eddy starts by brainstorming ideas, then takes a break, and later reviews and polishes his work. This step-by-step progression allows for focused and deep work on each component of the composition, which can foster creativity as Eddy can concentrate on developing each part without feeling rushed or distracted by the magnitude of the entire project.\n\nMoreover, incorporating breaks, such as a short walk or a light snack, as part of the task decomposition process, can help refresh the mind and provide new perspectives, leading to increased creativity. Regular breaks prevent burnout and keep the mind alert, which is essential for both productivity and creative endeavors.\n\nIn summary, the principles of time management and task decomposition can greatly enhance productivity and creativity in academic assignments by providing a structured approach to work, reducing task complexity, and allowing for regular breaks to rejuvenate one's mental state. This approach can lead to more effective learning and higher quality outcomes in academic pursuits.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The principles of time management and task decomposition, as applied to academic pursuits, can significantly enhance both productivity and creativity. By allocating specific time slots to different tasks, much like Eddy Lin does for his music composition, students can ensure that each aspect of their work receives dedicated attention. This prevents any single task from becoming overwhelming and helps maintain a clear focus, which is conducive to a more organized and efficient workflow.\n\nTime management is essential as it allows students to prioritize their assignments and set aside time for each one. For instance, if a student plans to work on a research paper from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm, they can break this period down into smaller intervals, dedicating time to research, outlining, writing, and reviewing. This segmentation ensures a steady workflow and helps track progress, effectively preventing procrastination and maintaining productivity.\n\nTask decomposition complements time management by simplifying complex assignments into smaller, more manageable parts. This method makes daunting tasks seem more approachable. For example, a student might begin an assignment by researching, then take a break, followed by drafting and revising their work. This step-by-step approach allows for concentrated effort on each segment of the task, which can lead to enhanced creativity as the student can focus on refining each part without feeling overwhelmed by the entirety of the project.\n\nIncorporating breaks into the schedule, such as a short walk or a moment of relaxation, is also a critical element of task decomposition. These breaks serve to refresh the mind and often lead to new insights, contributing to a boost in creativity. They help prevent burnout and keep the mind sharp, which is vital for both productivity and creative work.\n\nIn conclusion, by adopting the principles of time management and task decomposition, students can greatly improve their productivity and creativity in academic assignments. This structured approach to work reduces the complexity of tasks and includes regular breaks to rejuvenate the mind, leading to more effective learning and higher-quality academic outcomes."}]}

They provide a straightforward\nway of creating simple agents that is still the most dominant ap-\nproach today [ 68,73,109], and can even handle rudimentary social\ninteractions, as shown in simulation games such as Mass Effect [ 12]\nand The Sims [ 6] series. Nonetheless, manually crafting behavior\nthat can comprehensively address the breadth of possible interac-\ntions in an open world is untenable. This means that the resulting\nagent behaviors may not fully represent the consequences of their\ninteractions [ 69\u201371], and cannot perform new procedures that were\nnot hard-coded in their script [ 90,96]. On the other hand, preva-\nlent learning-based approaches for creating believable agents, such\nas reinforcement learning, have overcome the challenge of man-\nual authoring by letting the agents learn their behavior, and have\nachieved superhuman performance in recent years in games such\nas AlphaStar for Starcraft [ 98] and OpenAI Five for Dota 2 [ 10].\nHowever, their success has largely taken place in adversarial games\nwith readily definable rewards that a learning algorithm can op-\ntimize for. They have not yet addressed the challenge of creating\nbelievable agents in an open world [39, 73, 90].\nCognitive architectures in computation, pioneered by Newell,\naimed to build the infrastructure for supporting a comprehensive\nset of cognitive functions [ 75] that suited the all-encompassing\nnature of believable agents held in its original vision. They fueled\nsome of the earliest examples of believable agents. For instance,\nQuakebot-SOAR [ 59] and ICARUS [ 24,63] generated NPCs in first-\nperson shooter games, while TacAir-SOAR [ 80] generated pilots in\naerial combat training simulations. The architectures used by these\nagents differed (Quakebot- and TacAir-SOAR relied on SOAR [ 60],\nwhile ICARUS relied on its own variation that was inspired by\nSOAR and ACT-R [ 5]), but they shared the same underlying prin-\nciple [ 61]. They maintained short-term and long-term memories,\nfilled these memories with symbolic structures, and operated in\nperceive-plan-act cycles, dynamically perceiving the environment\nand matching it with one of the manually crafted action proce-\ndures [ 57,96]. Agents created using cognitive architectures aimed\nto be generalizable to most, if not all, open-world contexts and\nexhibited robust behavior for their time. However, their space of\naction was limited to manually crafted procedural knowledge, and\nthey did not offer a mechanism through which the agents could be\ninspired to seek new behavior. As such, these agents were deployed\nmostly in non-open-world contexts such as first-person shooter\ngames [24, 59] or blocks worlds [63].\nToday, creating believable agents as described in its original\ndefinition remains an open problem [ 84,108]. Many have moved on,\narguing that although existing approaches for creating believable\nagents might be cumbersome and limited, they are good enough\nto support existing gameplay and interactions [ 23,74,108]. Our\nargument is that large language models offer an opportunity to\nre-examine these questions, provided that we can craft an effective\narchitecture to synthesize memories into believable behavior. We\noffer a step toward such an architecture in this paper.2.3 Large Language Models and Human\nBehavior\nGenerative agents leverage a large language model to power their\nbehavior. The key observation is that large language models en-\ncode a wide range of human behavior represented in their training\ndata [ 14,17]. If prompted with a narrowly defined context, the\nmodels can be used to generate believable behavior. Recent work\nhas demonstrated the efficacy of this approach. For instance, Social\nSimulacra used a large language model to generate users that would\npopulate new social computing systems to prototype their emergent\nsocial dynamics [ 79]. This approach used a prompt chain [ 105,106]\nto generate short natural language descriptions of personas and\ntheir behaviors as they appear in the system being prototyped.\nOther empirical studies have replicated existing social science stud-\nies [45], political surveys [ 91], and generated synthetic data [ 38].\n\npage_label: 2\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S.

From sandbox games such as The Sims\nto applications such as cognitive models [ 21] and virtual environ-\nments [ 9,58], for over four decades researchers and practitioners\nhave envisioned computational agents that can serve as believ-\nable proxies of human behavior. In these visions, computationally-\npowered agents act consistently with their past experiences and\nreact believably to their environments. Such simulations of human\nbehavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with real-\nistic social phenomena [ 26,79], train people how to handle rare yet\ndifficult interpersonal situations [ 43,51,93], test social science theo-\nries [ 11,45], craft model human processors for theory and usability\ntesting [ 21,38,50], power ubiquitous computing applications [ 30]\nand social robots [ 9,13], and underpin non-playable game charac-\nters [ 58,84] that can navigate complex human relationships in an\nopen world.\nHowever, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [ 84,\n108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [ 17] that\ncan simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [ 38,\n79], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would\nbe better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing\nmemories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade\nover time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold\nbetween multiple agents.

Generative agents draw\na wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and\ntheir environment; they create daily plans that reflect their char-\nacteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan\nwhen appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their\nenvironment or commands them in natural language.

Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences.

Agents converse as they interact with each other.\nWe generate agents\u2019 dialogue by conditioning their utterances on\ntheir memories about each other. For example, when John initiates\nhis conversation with Eddy, we generate John\u2019s first utterance\nby using his summarized memory about Eddy and the intended\nreaction when he decided to ask Eddy about his composition project:\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description]\nIt is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm.\nJohn Lin\u2019s status: John is back home early from\nwork.\nObservation: John saw Eddy taking a short walk\naround his workplace.\nSummary of relevant context from John\u2019s memory:\nEddy Lin is John\u2019s Lin\u2019s son. Eddy Lin has been\nworking on a music composition for his class. Eddy\nLin likes to walk around the garden when he is\nthinking about or listening to music.\nJohn is asking Eddy about his music composition\nproject. What would he say to Eddy?\nThe result: \u201cHey Eddy, how\u2019s the music composition project for your\nclass coming along?\u201d From Eddy\u2019s perspective, John initiating the\ndialogue is seen as an event to which he may want to react. So, just\nas John did, Eddy retrieves and summarizes his memory about his\nrelationship with John, as well as his memory that may be related\nto John\u2019s last utterance in the dialogue. If he decides to respond,\nwe generate Eddy\u2019s utterance using his summarized memory and\nthe current dialogue history:\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description]\nIt is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm.\nEddy Lin\u2019s status: Eddy is taking a short walk\naround his workplace.\nObservation: John is initiating a conversation\nwith Eddy.\nSummary of relevant context from Eddy\u2019s memory:\nJonn Lin is Eddy Lin\u2019s father. John Lin is caring\nand is interested to learn more about Eddy Lin\u2019s\nschool work. John Lin knows that Eddy Lin is\nworking on a music composition.\nHere is the dialogue history:\nJohn: Hey Eddy, how\u2019s the music composition project\nfor your class coming along?\nHow would Eddy respond to John?\nThis generates Eddy\u2019s response: \u201cHey Dad, it\u2019s going well. I\u2019ve been\ntaking walks around the garden to clear my head and get some in-\nspiration.\u201d The continuation of this dialogue is generated using the\nsame mechanism until one of the two agents decides to end the\ndialogue.\n5 SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT\nIMPLEMENTATION\nThe Smallville sandbox game environment is built using the Phaser\nweb game development framework [ 56]. The visual environmentsprites, including agent avatars, as well as an environment map\nand collision map that we authored, are imported into Phaser.\nWe supplement the sandbox development framework with a\nserver that makes the sandbox information available to generative\nagents and enables generative agents to move and influence the\nsandbox environment. The server maintains a JSON data structure\nthat contains information about each agent in the sandbox world,\nincluding their current location, a description of their current action,\nand the sandbox object they are interacting with. At each sandbox\ntime step, the sandbox server parses the JSON for any changes\ncoming from the generative agents, moves the agents to their new\npositions, and updates the status of any sandbox objects that the\nagents are interacting with (e.g., changing the status of the coffee\nmachine from \u201cidle\u201d to \u201cbrewing coffee\u201d if an agent\u2019s action is\n\u201cmaking espresso for a customer @ Hobbs Cafe: counter: coffee\nmachine\u201d). The sandbox server is also responsible for sending all\nagents and objects that are within a preset visual range for each\nagent to that agent\u2019s memory, so the agent can react appropriately.\nThe agent\u2019s output action then updates the JSON, and the process\nloops for the next time step.\nEnd users initialize a new agent with a brief natural language\ndescription, as in the paragraph about Jon Lin in Section 3.1. In our\nimplementation, we split this semicolon-delimited list of character-\nistics up into a set of memories. These serve as the initial memories\nthat determine the agent\u2019s behavior. These memories are initial\nstarting points: as the agents gain more experience in the sandbox\nworld, and as more records saturate the memory stream, the agent\u2019s\nsummary and behavior will evolve.\n\npage_label: 3\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nbehaviors in isolation, and an end-to-end evaluation where the\ngenerative agents interacted with each other in open-ended ways\nover two days of game time to understand their stability and emer-\ngent social behaviors. In the technical evaluation, we leverage a\nmethodological opportunity to evaluate an agent\u2019s knowledge and\nbehavior by \u201cinterviewing\u201d it in natural language to probe agents\u2019\nability to stay in character, remember, plan, react, and reflect accu-\nrately. We compared several ablations that limit agents\u2019 access to\nmemory, reflection, and planning. We observe that each of these\ncomponents is critical to strong performance across these inter-\nview tasks. Across the technical and the end-to-end evaluation, the\nmost common errors arose when the agent failed to retrieve rele-\nvant memories, fabricated embellishments to the agent\u2019s memory,\nor inherited overly formal speech or behavior from the language\nmodel.\nIn sum, this paper provides the following contributions:\n\u2022Generative agents , believable simulacra of human behavior\nthat are dynamically conditioned on agents\u2019 changing expe-\nriences and environment.\n\u2022A novel architecture that makes it possible for generative\nagents to remember, retrieve, reflect, interact with other\nagents, and plan through dynamically evolving circumstances.\nThe architecture leverages the powerful prompting capabili-\nties of large language models and supplements those capa-\nbilities to support longer-term agent coherence, the ability\nto manage dynamically-evolving memory, and recursively\nproduce more generations.\n\u2022Two evaluations (a controlled evaluation and end-to-end\nevaluation) that establish causal effects of the importance\nof components of the architecture, as well as identify break-\ndowns arising from, e.g., improper memory retrieval.\n\u2022Discussion of the opportunities and ethical and societal risks\nof generative agents in interactive systems.

This agenda, once hailed as a\nnorth star in interaction, game, and artificial intelligence communi-\nties [ 9,58,84,85], has remained challenging due to the complexity\nof human behavior [ 16,108].

When an agent initiates a conversation, the system generates the first utterance using a summary of the agent's memory about the other party and the intended reaction.

This process allows for a coherent and contextually relevant conversation that takes into account the agents' relationship, their knowledge of each other's activities, and their recent interactions. The dialogue generation mechanism ensures that agents react appropriately to each other's statements, maintaining the flow of conversation until one of the agents decides to end the dialogue.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the realm of Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior, the creation of dialogue between agents is a sophisticated process that involves the integration of several key factors to produce natural and contextually appropriate conversational responses. The dialogue generation system utilizes a model of each agent's memory, which encompasses their understanding of the relationship dynamics, past interactions, and any pertinent observations of one another.\n\nWhen an agent begins a conversation, the system crafts the initial utterance by drawing on this memory model, ensuring that the dialogue is relevant to the shared history and current situation. For instance, if one agent is aware that the other has been engaged in a particular task or hobby, the conversation might start with a reference to that activity.\n\nAs the dialogue progresses, each agent's response is shaped by an ongoing synthesis of their memory model and the evolving conversation. This allows for a dynamic and coherent exchange that takes into account the agents' knowledge of each other's interests and activities, as well as any recent developments in their interaction.\n\nThe system's ability to generate dialogue is further refined by considering factors such as the agents' intended emotional tone, the objectives of the conversation, and the potential reactions of the other party. This results in a nuanced and believable interaction that mirrors the complexity of human communication, where agents can engage in meaningful exchanges that extend their capabilities and enhance the user experience in interactive systems."}]}

Each agent is\nrepresented by a simple sprite avatar. We authored one paragraph\nof natural language description to depict each agent\u2019s identity,\nincluding their occupation and relationship with other agents, as\nseed memories. For example, John Lin has the following description:\nJohn Lin is a pharmacy shopkeeper at the Willow\nMarket and Pharmacy who loves to help people. He\nis always looking for ways to make the process\nof getting medication easier for his customers;\nJohn Lin is living with his wife, Mei Lin, who\nis a college professor, and son, Eddy Lin, who is\na student studying music theory; John Lin loves\nhis family very much; John Lin has known the old\ncouple next-door, Sam Moore and Jennifer Moore,\nfor a few years; John Lin thinks Sam Moore is a\nkind and nice man; John Lin knows his neighbor,\nYuriko Yamamoto, well; John Lin knows of his\nneighbors, Tamara Taylor and Carmen Ortiz, but\nhas not met them before; John Lin and Tom Moreno\nare colleagues at The Willows Market and Pharmacy;\nJohn Lin and Tom Moreno are friends and like to\ndiscuss local politics together; John Lin knows\nthe Moreno family somewhat well \u2014 the husband Tom\nMoreno and the wife Jane Moreno.\nEach semicolon-delimited phrase is entered into the agent\u2019s initial\nmemory as memories at the start of the simulation.3.1.1 Inter-Agent Communication. The agents interact with the\nworld by their actions, and with each other through natural lan-\nguage. At each time step of the sandbox engine, the agents output a\nnatural language statement describing their current action, such as\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is writing in her journal\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is\nchecking her emails\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is talking with her family\non the phone\", or \"Isabella Rodriguez is getting ready for bed\". This\nstatement is then translated into concrete movements that affect the\nsandbox world. The action is displayed on the sandbox interface as\na set of emojis that provide an abstract representation of the action\nin the overhead view. To accomplish this, the system employs a\nlanguage model that translates the action into a set of emojis, which\nappear above each avatar in a speech bubble. For example, \"Isabella\nRodriguez is writing in her journal\" is displayed as\n , while\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is checking her emails\" appears as\n . The\nfull natural language description of the action can be accessed by\nclicking on the agent avatar.\nAgents communicate with each other in full natural language.\nAgents are aware of other agents in their local area, and the genera-\ntive agent architecture determines whether they walk by or engage\nin conversation. Here, a sample in the middle of a conversation\nbetween the agents Isabella Rodriguez and Tom Moreno about the\nupcoming election:2\nIsabella : I\u2019m still weighing my options, but I\u2019ve been\ndiscussing the election with Sam Moore. What are your\nthoughts on him?\nTom: To be honest, I don\u2019t like Sam Moore. I think he\u2019s\nout of touch with the community and doesn\u2019t have our\nbest interests at heart.\n2We note that the conversational style of these agents can fe el overly formal, likely a\nresult of instruction tuning in the underlying models. We expect that writing style\nwill be better controllable in future language models.\n\npage_label: 6\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S. Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\n3.1.2 User Controls. A user running this simulation can steer the\nsimulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent\nthrough conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the\nform of an \u2018inner voice\u2019.\nThe user communicates with the agent through natural language,\nby specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For\nexample, if the user specifies that they are a news \u201creporter\u201d and\nasks about the upcoming election, \u201cWho is running for office?\u201d, the\nJohn agent replies:\nJohn : My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking\nabout the upcoming election and discussing the candi-\ndate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him\nbecause we like his platform.\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the per-\nsona of the agent\u2019s \u201cinner voice\u201d\u2014this makes the agent more likely\nto treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told \u201cYou\nare going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\u201d by a user\nas John\u2019s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares\nhis candidacy with his wife and son.\n3.2 Environmental Interaction\nSmallville features the common affordances of a small village in-\ncluding a cafe, bar, park, school, dorm, houses, and stores. It also\ndefines subareas and objects that make those spaces functional,\nsuch as a kitchen in a house and a stove in the kitchen (Figure 2).\nAll spaces serving as agents\u2019 primary living quarters feature a bed,\ndesk, closet, shelf, as well as a bathroom and a kitchen.3\nAgents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video\ngame, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and ap-\nproaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the gen-\nerative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the\nmodel dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate\na walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment\nand the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the\nsandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The\nagent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in\nthe world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor\nwith no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville\nwill treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat\neach other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and\nremember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\nUsers and agents can influence the state of the objects in this\nworld, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example,\na bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator\ncan be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make\nbreakfast. End users can also reshape an agent\u2019s environment in\nSmallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent\nin natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast\nin the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove\nfrom \u201cturned on\u201d to \u201cburning\u201d by inputting a command to the\nsystem that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like\nthis: \u201c<Isabella\u2019s apartment: kitchen: stove> is burning.\u201d Isabella\nwill notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove\n3This environment design is not the focus of our work, so we generate this environment\nmanually, not automatically.

As time passes in the sandbox world, their behaviors\nevolve as these agents interact with each other and the world, build\nmemories and relationships, and coordinate joint activities.\nWe demonstrate the behavior of generative agents by tracing the\noutput of our system over the course of one day for the agent John\nLin (Figure 3). In the Lin family, John is the first to wake up at 7 a.m.\nHe brushes his teeth, takes a shower, gets dressed, eats breakfast,\nand checks the news at the dining table in the living room.\nQuery: In the Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior study, describe the method by which agents in the Smallville sandbox world represent and recall the environment they have interacted with.\nOriginal Answer: Agents in the Smallville sandbox world represent and recall the environment they have interacted with by remembering a subgraph of the world.

Bernstein\ntest these robustness issues, and as large language models become\nmore resilient to such attacks, generative agents can adopt similar\nmitigations.\n8.3 Ethics and Societal Impact\nGenerative agents, while offering new possibilities for human-\ncomputer interaction, also raise important ethical concerns that\nmust be addressed. One risk is people forming parasocial relation-\nships with generative agents even when such relationships may\nnot be appropriate. Despite being aware that generative agents\nare computational entities, users may anthropomorphize them or\nattach human emotions to them [ 42,83]. To mitigate this risk, we\npropose two principles. First, generative agents should explicitly\ndisclose their nature as computational entities. Second, developers\nof generative agents must ensure that the agents, or the underlying\nlanguage models, be value-aligned so that they do not engage in\nbehaviors that would be inappropriate given the context, e.g., to\nreciprocate confessions of love.\nA second risk is the impact of errors. For example, if a ubiquitous\ncomputing application makes the wrong inference about a user\u2019s\ngoals based on generative agent predictions, it could produce an-\nnoyance at best and outright harm at worst. In our instantiation\nof generative agents, we mitigate these risks by focusing on an\ninteractive video game environment, where such harms are un-\nlikely. However, in other application domains, it will be important\nto follow best practices in human-AI design [ 4,107] to understand\nerrors and how they might percolate into the user experience.\nThird, generative agents may exacerbate existing risks associ-\nated with generative AI, for example deepfakes, misinformation\ngeneration, and tailored persuasion. To mitigate this risk, we sug-\ngest that platforms hosting generative agents maintain an audit log\nof the inputs and generated outputs, so that it is possible to detect,\nverify, and intervene against malicious use. While logging will not\ndirectly stop such use, and this cannot stop motivated actors that\nbuild their own generative agent infrastructures, we suggest that\nthe disclosure risk would reduce such actors\u2019 likelihood of engaging\nin this behavior, and building this architecture oneself can take time\n(in our case, roughly a year).\nA fourth risk is of over-reliance: that developers or designers\nmight use generative agents and displace the role of humans and\nsystem stakeholders in the design process [ 79]. We suggest that\ngenerative agents should never be a substitute for real human input\nin studies and design processes. Instead, they should be used to\nprototype ideas in the early stages of design when gathering partic-\nipants may be challenging or when testing theories that are difficult\nor risky to test with real human participants. By adhering to these\nprinciples, we can ensure that the deployment of generative agents\nin the wild is ethical and socially responsible.\n9 CONCLUSION\nThis paper introduces generative agents, interactive computational\nagents that simulate human behavior. We describe an architec-\nture for generative agents that provides a mechanism for storing\na comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experiences, deepening its\nunderstanding of itself and the environment through reflection,\nand retrieving a compact subset of that information to inform theagent\u2019s actions. We then demonstrate the potential of generative\nagents by manifesting them as non-player characters in a Sims-style\ngame world and simulating their lives in it. Evaluations suggest that\nour architecture creates believable behavior. Going forward, we\nsuggest that generative agents can play roles in many interactive\napplications ranging from design tools to social computing systems\nto immersive environments.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Robert Ackland, Jamsheed Shorish, Paul Thomas, and Lexing Xie. 2013.\nHow dense is a network? http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/teaching/css2013/\nnetwork-density.html.\n[2]Eytan Adar, Mira Dontcheva, and Gierad Laput. 2014.

Recently, this technology has become stable enough\nthat it has become possible for agents to interact via natural lan-\nguage in large and complex online social environments (e.g., [ 54]).\nNatural language interaction offers a novel modality that can ex-\ntend user abilities in domains such as photo editing [ 2,34,64] and\ncode editing [87].\nWe convene these threads of work to show that we can now\ncreate agents that proxy human behavior for interactive systems,\nand interact with them via natural language.\nQuery: Considering the ethical implications discussed in the paper \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,\" what are the two principles proposed by the authors to mitigate the risk of users forming inappropriate parasocial relationships with generative agents?\nOriginal Answer: The two principles proposed to mitigate the risk of users forming inappropriate parasocial relationships with generative agents are: first, generative agents should explicitly disclose their nature as computational entities; and second, developers must ensure that the agents, or the underlying language models, are value-aligned so that they do not engage in behaviors that would be inappropriate given the context, such as reciprocating confessions of love.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To mitigate the risk of users forming inappropriate parasocial relationships with generative agents, the authors propose two principles: firstly, it is essential for generative agents to be transparent about their artificial nature, making it clear to users that they are interacting with a computational system; and secondly, it is crucial for the design and development of these agents to be guided by ethical considerations, ensuring that they behave in a manner consistent with societal values and do not respond inappropriately to sensitive user interactions, such as expressions of affection."}]}

Agents perceive their environment, and all perceptions are saved in a compre-\nhensive record of the agent\u2019s experiences called the memory stream. Based on their perceptions, the architecture retrieves\nrelevant memories, then uses those retrieved actions to determine an action. These retrieved memories are also used to form\nlonger-term plans, and to create higher-level reflections, which are both entered into the memory stream for future use.\nto throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors\nof spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving\nat the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were\ninitiated by the agent architecture.\n4 GENERATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\nopen world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\nand can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the\narchitecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language\ndescription, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language\nmodel.\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-\nGPT [ 76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\nagents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the\nsame as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\nof the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, how-\never, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n4.1 Memory and Retrieval\nChallenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\nbehavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\nlarger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full mem-\nory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\ninto the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent an-\nswering the question \u201cWhat are you passionate about these days?\u201d.\nFirst summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited\ncontext window of the language model produces an uninformative\nresponse, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\nevents and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. In-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp.

Retrieval of Relevant Memories: The memory stream allows the agent to retrieve memories that are pertinent to the current situation. By surfacing relevant memories, the agent can produce responses and behaviors that are informed by past experiences, making them more specific and informative. For example, when asked about passions, the agent can recall specific memories related to making people feel welcome and included, rather than providing a generic summary of experiences.\n\n2. Planning and Reaction: The retrieved memories from the memory stream are used by the agent to plan actions and react appropriately to the environment. This ensures that the agent's behavior is not only based on the immediate context but also considers past interactions and events, which contributes to a more realistic and human-like behavior pattern.\n\n3. Formation of Long-term Plans: The agent uses the retrieved memories to form longer-term plans. This aspect of the memory stream helps the agent to maintain coherence over time, as it can reference and build upon past plans and experiences.\n\n4. Creation of Higher-level Reflections: The architecture allows for the synthesis of retrieved memories into higher-level reflections. These reflections are then entered back into the memory stream, further enriching the agent's database of experiences and enhancing its ability to generate complex and nuanced behaviors.\n\n5. Natural Language Processing: Since the memory stream and all its records are maintained as natural language descriptions, it enables the agent to leverage large language models effectively. This integration allows the agent to process and reason over its memories using advanced language understanding, which is essential for generating human-like interactions.\n\nIn summary, the memory stream is integral to the Generative Agent Architecture as it provides a dynamic and evolving foundation of experiences that the agent draws upon to exhibit coherent, contextually relevant, and sophisticated behaviors akin to human behavior."}]}

Agents perceive their environment, and all perceptions are saved in a compre-\nhensive record of the agent\u2019s experiences called the memory stream. Based on their perceptions, the architecture retrieves\nrelevant memories, then uses those retrieved actions to determine an action. These retrieved memories are also used to form\nlonger-term plans, and to create higher-level reflections, which are both entered into the memory stream for future use.\nto throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors\nof spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving\nat the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were\ninitiated by the agent architecture.\n4 GENERATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\nopen world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\nand can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the\narchitecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language\ndescription, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language\nmodel.\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-\nGPT [ 76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\nagents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the\nsame as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\nof the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, how-\never, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n4.1 Memory and Retrieval\nChallenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\nbehavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\nlarger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full mem-\nory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\ninto the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent an-\nswering the question \u201cWhat are you passionate about these days?\u201d.\nFirst summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited\ncontext window of the language model produces an uninformative\nresponse, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\nevents and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. In-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\nof the memory stream is an observation , which is an event directly\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors\nperformed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents per-\nceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: In the context of the memory stream mechanism described in the document \"Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,\" how does the agent record and utilize observations to enhance its interactions, as exemplified by Isabella Rodriguez's activities at the coffee shop?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The agent records observations as memory objects within a memory stream, which is a comprehensive record of the agent's experiences. Each memory object includes a natural language description of the event, along with creation and most recent access timestamps. Observations are events that the agent directly perceives, such as actions performed by the agent or others in the environment.\n\nIn the case of Isabella Rodriguez at the coffee shop, her activities, like setting out pastries or planning a Valentine's Day party, are recorded as observations in the memory stream. When the agent needs to interact or make decisions, it retrieves relevant memories from the memory stream to inform its actions and responses. This retrieval process allows the agent to produce behavior that is informed by past experiences, making its interactions more specific and relevant to the current context.\n\nFor example, when asked about her passions, instead of providing a generic summary, the memory stream allows Isabella to give a specific response that reflects her experiences and interests, such as her passion for making people feel welcome and included, and her involvement in event planning, as demonstrated by her efforts in organizing the Valentine's Day party. This results in a more informative and personalized interaction that is grounded in the agent's recorded observations."}]}

Retrieval identifies a subset of these observations that should be passed to the language model to condition its\nresponse to the situation.\nOur architecture implements a retrieval function that takes the\nagent\u2019s current situation as input and returns a subset of the mem-\nory stream to pass on to the language model. There are many pos-\nsible implementations of a retrieval function, depending on what\nit is important that the agent consider when deciding how to act.\nIn our context, we focus on three main components that together\nproduce effective results.\nRecency assigns a higher score to memory objects that were re-\ncently accessed, so that events from a moment ago or this morning\nare likely to remain in the agent\u2019s attentional sphere. In our im-\nplementation, we treat recency as an exponential decay function\nover the number of sandbox game hours since the memory was\nlast retrieved. Our decay factor is 0.99.\nImportance distinguishes mundane from core memories, by as-\nsigning a higher score to those memory objects that the agent\nbelieves to be important. For instance, a mundane event such as\neating breakfast in one\u2019s room would yield a low importance score,\nwhereas a breakup with one\u2019s significant other would yield a high\nscore. There are again many possible implementations of an im-\nportance score; we find that directly asking the language model to\noutput an integer score is effective. The full prompt appears below:\nOn the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is purely mundane\n(e.g., brushing teeth, making bed) and 10 is\nextremely poignant (e.g., a break up, college\nacceptance), rate the likely poignancy of the\nfollowing piece of memory.\nMemory: buying groceries at The Willows Market\nand Pharmacy\nRating: <fill in>This prompt returns an integer value of 2for \u201ccleaning up the room\u201d\nand8for \u201casking your crush out on a date.\u201d The importance score\nis generated at the time the memory object is created.\nRelevance assigns a higher score to memory objects that are\nrelated to the current situation. What is relevant depends on the\nanswer to, \u201cRelevant to what? \u201d, so we condition relevance on a\nquery memory. If the query, for example, is that a student is dis-\ncussing what to study for a chemistry test with a classmate, memory\nobjects about their breakfast should have low relevance, whereas\nmemory objects about the teacher and schoolwork should have\nhigh relevance. In our implementation, we use the language model\nto generate an embedding vector of the text description of each\nmemory. Then, we calculate relevance as the cosine similarity be-\ntween the memory\u2019s embedding vector and the query memory\u2019s\nembedding vector.\nTo calculate the final retrieval score, we normalize the recency,\nrelevance, and importance scores to the range of [0,1]by min-max\nscaling. The retrieval function scores all memories as a weighted\ncombination of the three elements: \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 =\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66\u00b7\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66+\n\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\u00b7\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52+\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\u00b7\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52 .

Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Based on the retrieval function described in the context of the Generative Agents, explain how the three components\u2014recency, importance, and relevance\u2014contribute to the agent's decision-making process when selecting which memories to use in a given situation.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The retrieval function in the Generative Agents' architecture uses three components\u2014recency, importance, and relevance\u2014to determine which memories should be used to condition the agent's response in a given situation. \n\nRecency affects the decision-making process by prioritizing memories that have been accessed more recently.

The agent assigns a higher score to memories it deems important. For example, a memory of a significant life event would be rated as more important than a routine daily activity. The importance of each memory is determined by asking the language model to assign an integer score to the memory, which influences the likelihood of that memory being retrieved for use in the current context.\n\nRelevance ensures that the memories considered are pertinent to the agent's current situation.

Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences.

However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that.

The agent assigns a higher score to memories it deems important. For example, a memory of a significant life event would be rated as more important than a routine daily activity. The importance of each memory is determined by asking the language model to assign an integer score to the memory, which influences the likelihood of that memory being retrieved for use in the current context.\n\nRelevance ensures that the memories considered are pertinent to the agent's current situation.

In the described implementation, each component is equally weighted. The top-ranked memories, according to this combined score, are then included in the prompt for the language model, which influences the agent's response to the situation at hand.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The retrieval function of Generative Agents is designed to select memories based on three key components: recency, importance, and relevance. These components work together to shape the agent's decision-making process.\n\nRecency influences the decision-making by giving preference to memories that have been accessed or created more recently. This is based on the idea that recent events are more likely to be relevant to the current situation. The system uses an exponential decay function to assign higher scores to newer memories, ensuring that they remain within the agent's immediate consideration.\n\nImportance is factored into the decision-making by evaluating the significance of each memory. The agent assesses the weight of a memory based on its perceived impact or significance. Significant events, therefore, receive a higher importance score than everyday occurrences. The importance of a memory is quantified by an integer score, which is then used to influence the probability of that memory being retrieved.\n\nRelevance is the third component, which ensures that the memories being considered are directly related to the current context. The agent measures the relevance of a memory by comparing it to the present circumstances or the query at hand. This comparison is typically done by calculating the cosine similarity between the embedding vectors of the memory and the query, ensuring that the retrieved memories are contextually appropriate.\n\nWhen selecting memories to inform its response, the agent combines the normalized scores of recency, importance, and relevance, often using a weighted sum where each factor contributes equally. The memories with the highest combined scores are then used to condition the agent's response, allowing it to react in a manner that is informed by its most recent, important, and relevant experiences."}]}

From sandbox games such as The Sims\nto applications such as cognitive models [ 21] and virtual environ-\nments [ 9,58], for over four decades researchers and practitioners\nhave envisioned computational agents that can serve as believ-\nable proxies of human behavior. In these visions, computationally-\npowered agents act consistently with their past experiences and\nreact believably to their environments. Such simulations of human\nbehavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with real-\nistic social phenomena [ 26,79], train people how to handle rare yet\ndifficult interpersonal situations [ 43,51,93], test social science theo-\nries [ 11,45], craft model human processors for theory and usability\ntesting [ 21,38,50], power ubiquitous computing applications [ 30]\nand social robots [ 9,13], and underpin non-playable game charac-\nters [ 58,84] that can navigate complex human relationships in an\nopen world.\nHowever, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [ 84,\n108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [ 17] that\ncan simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [ 38,\n79], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would\nbe better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing\nmemories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade\nover time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold\nbetween multiple agents. Success requires an approach that can\nretrieve relevant events and interactions over a long period, reflect\non those memories to generalize and draw higher-level inferences,\nand apply that reasoning to create plans and reactions that both\nmake sense in the moment and in the longer-term arc of the agent\u2019s\nbehavior.\nIn this paper, we introduce generative agents \u2014agents that draw\non generative models to simulate believable human behavior\u2014anddemonstrate that they produce believable simulacra of both in-\ndividual and emergent group behavior. Generative agents draw\na wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and\ntheir environment; they create daily plans that reflect their char-\nacteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan\nwhen appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their\nenvironment or commands them in natural language. For instance,\ngenerative agents turn off the stove when they see that their break-\nfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and\nstop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social\ndynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses,\nand coordination arises across agents.\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture\nthat stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate\nbelievable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture\ncomprises three main components.

It meticulously records the agent's experiences in a form that mirrors natural language, thus equipping the agent with a detailed history of its interactions and events that have transpired.\n\nNext, the retrieval model serves as a crucial mechanism for memory selection. It sifts through the memory stream, guided by factors such as relevance to the current context, the temporal proximity of memories (recency), and the significance of past experiences (importance). This enables the agent to retrieve and utilize memories that are most pertinent to its present actions and decisions.\n\nWhile the third component is not explicitly detailed in the context provided, it is implied that this component would involve the integration and application of the selected memories. This process would likely include the generation of complex behaviors and strategic planning based on the agent's accumulated experiences.\n\nBy integrating these components, generative agents are endowed with the capability to formulate and execute daily agendas that are reflective of their unique characteristics and accumulated experiences. They can dynamically interact with their environment, adjusting their actions and strategies in response to new stimuli or instructions provided in natural language by users. This architecture underpins the emergence of sophisticated social dynamics, fostering the development of new relationships, the propagation of information, and collaborative efforts among agents. The result is a more authentic emulation of human behavior within the interactive sandbox setting, enabling these agents to convincingly mimic the nuances of human interactions and societal functions."}]}

If prompted with a narrowly defined context, the\nmodels can be used to generate believable behavior. Recent work\nhas demonstrated the efficacy of this approach. For instance, Social\nSimulacra used a large language model to generate users that would\npopulate new social computing systems to prototype their emergent\nsocial dynamics [ 79]. This approach used a prompt chain [ 105,106]\nto generate short natural language descriptions of personas and\ntheir behaviors as they appear in the system being prototyped.\nOther empirical studies have replicated existing social science stud-\nies [45], political surveys [ 91], and generated synthetic data [ 38].\nLarge language models have also been used to generate interactive\nhuman behavior for users to engage with. In gaming, for instance,\nthese models have been employed to create interactive fiction [ 36]\nand text adventure games [ 20]. With their ability to generate and\ndecompose action sequences, large language models have also been\nused in planning robotics tasks [ 47]. For example, when presented\nwith a task, such as picking up a bottle, the model is prompted to\nbreak down the task into smaller action sequences, such as heading\nto the table where the bottle is located and picking it up.\nWe posit that, based on the work summarized above, large lan-\nguage models can become a key ingredient for creating believable\nagents. The existing literature largely relies on what could be con-\nsidered first-order templates that employ few-shot prompts [ 37,65]\nor chain-of-thought prompts [ 99]. These templates are effective in\ngenerating behavior that is conditioned solely on the agent\u2019s cur-\nrent environment (e.g., how would a troll respond to a given post,\nwhat actions would a robot need to take to enter a room given that\nthere is a door). However, believable agents require conditioning\nnot only on their current environment but also on a vast amount\nof past experience, which is a poor fit (and as of today, impossi-\nble due to the underlying models\u2019 limited context window) using\nfirst-order prompting. Recent studies have attempted to go beyond\nfirst-order prompting by augmenting language models with a static\nknowledge base and an information retrieval scheme [ 52] or with\na simple summarization scheme [ 104]. This paper extends these\nideas to craft an agent architecture that handles retrieval where\npast experience is dynamically updated at each time step and mixed\nwith agents\u2019 current context and plans, which may either reinforce\nor contradict each other.\n3 GENERATIVE AGENT BEHAVIOR AND\nINTERACTION\nTo make concrete the affordances of generative agents, we instanti-\nate them as characters in a simple sandbox world reminiscent of\nThe Sims [ 6]. This sprite-based sandbox game world, Smallville,\nevokes a small town environment. In this section, we walk through\nthe affordances and interactions with generative agents in Small-\nville, and describe how the agents behave in it. Then, in Section 4,\nwe introduce our generative agent architecture that powers these\naffordances and interactions. In Section 5, we describe the sandbox\n\npage_label: 4\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S. Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\ntrees [ 40,53,81], account for the brute force approach of human-\nauthoring the agent\u2019s behavior [ 70]. They provide a straightforward\nway of creating simple agents that is still the most dominant ap-\nproach today [ 68,73,109], and can even handle rudimentary social\ninteractions, as shown in simulation games such as Mass Effect [ 12]\nand The Sims [ 6] series. Nonetheless, manually crafting behavior\nthat can comprehensively address the breadth of possible interac-\ntions in an open world is untenable. This means that the resulting\nagent behaviors may not fully represent the consequences of their\ninteractions [ 69\u201371], and cannot perform new procedures that were\nnot hard-coded in their script [ 90,96]. On the other hand, preva-\nlent learning-based approaches for creating believable agents, such\nas reinforcement learning, have overcome the challenge of man-\nual authoring by letting the agents learn their behavior, and have\nachieved superhuman performance in recent years in games such\nas AlphaStar for Starcraft [ 98] and OpenAI Five for Dota 2 [ 10].\nHowever, their success has largely taken place in adversarial games\nwith readily definable rewards that a learning algorithm can op-\ntimize for. They have not yet addressed the challenge of creating\nbelievable agents in an open world [39, 73, 90].\nCognitive architectures in computation, pioneered by Newell,\naimed to build the infrastructure for supporting a comprehensive\nset of cognitive functions [ 75] that suited the all-encompassing\nnature of believable agents held in its original vision. They fueled\nsome of the earliest examples of believable agents. For instance,\nQuakebot-SOAR [ 59] and ICARUS [ 24,63] generated NPCs in first-\nperson shooter games, while TacAir-SOAR [ 80] generated pilots in\naerial combat training simulations. The architectures used by these\nagents differed (Quakebot- and TacAir-SOAR relied on SOAR [ 60],\nwhile ICARUS relied on its own variation that was inspired by\nSOAR and ACT-R [ 5]), but they shared the same underlying prin-\nciple [ 61]. They maintained short-term and long-term memories,\nfilled these memories with symbolic structures, and operated in\nperceive-plan-act cycles, dynamically perceiving the environment\nand matching it with one of the manually crafted action proce-\ndures [ 57,96]. Agents created using cognitive architectures aimed\nto be generalizable to most, if not all, open-world contexts and\nexhibited robust behavior for their time. However, their space of\naction was limited to manually crafted procedural knowledge, and\nthey did not offer a mechanism through which the agents could be\ninspired to seek new behavior. As such, these agents were deployed\nmostly in non-open-world contexts such as first-person shooter\ngames [24, 59] or blocks worlds [63].\nToday, creating believable agents as described in its original\ndefinition remains an open problem [ 84,108]. Many have moved on,\narguing that although existing approaches for creating believable\nagents might be cumbersome and limited, they are good enough\nto support existing gameplay and interactions [ 23,74,108]. Our\nargument is that large language models offer an opportunity to\nre-examine these questions, provided that we can craft an effective\narchitecture to synthesize memories into believable behavior. We\noffer a step toward such an architecture in this paper.2.3 Large Language Models and Human\nBehavior\nGenerative agents leverage a large language model to power their\nbehavior.

A user running this simulation can steer the\nsimulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent\nthrough conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the\nform of an \u2018inner voice\u2019.\nThe user communicates with the agent through natural language,\nby specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For\nexample, if the user specifies that they are a news \u201creporter\u201d and\nasks about the upcoming election, \u201cWho is running for office?\u201d, the\nJohn agent replies:\nJohn : My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking\nabout the upcoming election and discussing the candi-\ndate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him\nbecause we like his platform.\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the per-\nsona of the agent\u2019s \u201cinner voice\u201d\u2014this makes the agent more likely\nto treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told \u201cYou\nare going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\u201d by a user\nas John\u2019s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares\nhis candidacy with his wife and son.\n3.2 Environmental Interaction\nSmallville features the common affordances of a small village in-\ncluding a cafe, bar, park, school, dorm, houses, and stores. It also\ndefines subareas and objects that make those spaces functional,\nsuch as a kitchen in a house and a stove in the kitchen (Figure 2).\nAll spaces serving as agents\u2019 primary living quarters feature a bed,\ndesk, closet, shelf, as well as a bathroom and a kitchen.3\nAgents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video\ngame, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and ap-\nproaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the gen-\nerative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the\nmodel dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate\na walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment\nand the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the\nsandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The\nagent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in\nthe world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor\nwith no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville\nwill treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat\neach other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and\nremember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\nUsers and agents can influence the state of the objects in this\nworld, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example,\na bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator\ncan be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make\nbreakfast. End users can also reshape an agent\u2019s environment in\nSmallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent\nin natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast\nin the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove\nfrom \u201cturned on\u201d to \u201cburning\u201d by inputting a command to the\nsystem that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like\nthis: \u201c<Isabella\u2019s apartment: kitchen: stove> is burning.\u201d Isabella\nwill notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove\n3This environment design is not the focus of our work, so we generate this environment\nmanually, not automatically. Future work can continue to expand the richness of the\nagents\u2019 environments.and remake her breakfast. Likewise, if the user sets the status of\nIsabella\u2019s shower to \u201cleaking water\u201d when she enters the bathroom,\nshe gathers tools from her living room and try to fix the leak.\n3.3 Example \u201cDay in the Life\u201d\nStarting from the single-paragraph description, agents begin plan\ntheir days. As time passes in the sandbox world, their behaviors\nevolve as these agents interact with each other and the world, build\nmemories and relationships, and coordinate joint activities.\nWe demonstrate the behavior of generative agents by tracing the\noutput of our system over the course of one day for the agent John\nLin (Figure 3). In the Lin family, John is the first to wake up at 7 a.m.\nHe brushes his teeth, takes a shower, gets dressed, eats breakfast,\nand checks the news at the dining table in the living room.\n\npage_label: 17\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nretrieving the most relevant pieces of information but also in de-\ntermining the appropriate space to execute an action, given the\nincreasing number of locations that the agent learned about. As a\nresult, some agents chose less typical locations for their actions,\npotentially making their behavior less believable over time. For\ninstance, while deciding where to have lunch, many initially chose\nthe cafe. However, as some agents learned about a nearby bar, they\nopted to go there instead for lunch, even though the bar was in-\ntended to be a get-together location for later in the day unless the\ntown had spontaneously developed an afternoon drinking habit.\nSecond, we noticed erratic behaviors that were caused by misclas-\nsification of what is considered proper behavior, especially when\nthe physical norms of certain locations that are hard to convey\nin natural language did not percolate to the agents. For instance,\nthe college dorm has a bathroom that can only be occupied by\none person despite its name, but some agents assumed that the\nbathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms\ntend to support more than one person concurrently and choose\nto enter it when there is another person inside. Likewise, agents\nin Smallville may not realize that certain places are closed after\ncertain hours and decide to still enter them. For instance, the stores\nin Smallville all close around 5 pm, but occasionally, a few agents\nenter the store after 5 pm, not understanding that the shop has\nalready closed. These issues could likely be addressed by adding\nthese norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing\nthe dorm bathroom as \u201cone-person bathroom,\u201d instead of a \u201cdorm\nbathroom.\u201d\nFinally, we observed the possible effect of instruction tuning [ 78],\nwhich seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite\nand cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue\ngenerated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei\u2019s\nconversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the\nconversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries\nabout his day and ending with It was good talking to you as always.\nMoreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to\nmake the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example,\nIsabella heard a wide range of suggestions and ideas to include\nin the Valentine\u2019s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a\nShakespearean reading session or a professional networking event.\nDespite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and char-\nacteristics, she rarely said no. Over time, such interests of others\nshaped her own actual interest, and when asked if she liked English\nliterature, Isabella replied, Y es, I\u2019m very interested in literature! I\u2019ve\nalso been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in\nmy community.\n8 DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we reflect on applications, future work and limita-\ntions,\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: In the simulation described in the \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\" document, how can a user influence an agent's decision-making process, and what is an example of an action that an agent might take as a result of such an influence?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the simulation, a user can influence an agent's decision-making process in a couple of ways. First, a user can communicate with an agent through conversation, specifying a persona for the agent to perceive them as, such as a \"reporter.\" This can steer the agent's responses and actions based on the context of the conversation. For example, if a user, posing as a reporter, asks an agent named John about the upcoming election, John might discuss his support for a candidate named Sam Moore.\n\nSecondly, a user can issue a directive to an agent by taking on the persona of the agent's \"inner voice.\" This approach makes the agent treat the user's statement as a directive. For instance, if a user tells John, as his inner voice, \"You are going to run against Sam in the upcoming election,\" John may decide to run in the election and share his candidacy with his family.\n\nAn example of an action that an agent might take as a result of user influence is when the user changes the status of an object in the environment, such as turning a stove from \"turned on\" to \"burning.\" An agent named Isabella, upon noticing the burning stove, would then act to turn off the stove and remake her breakfast.

I\u2019ve\nalso been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in\nmy community.\n8 DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we reflect on applications, future work and limita-\ntions, and ethical and societal risks of generative agents.\n8.1 Applications of Generative Agents\nGenerative agents have vast potential applications that extend be-\nyond the sandbox demonstration presented in this work. For in-\nstance, social simulacra have demonstrated the ability to create\nstateless personas that generate conversation threads in online\nforums for social prototyping [ 79]. With generative agents, wecan populate these forums, as well as behavior in virtual reality\nmetaverses [ 77] and even physical spaces as social robots [ 8] in\nthe future, if paired with multi-modal models. This opens up the\npossibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human\nbehavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, and to\ncreate new interactive experiences.\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22]. Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\nsuch as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\nand what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the\nagent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for\nschool, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal\u2019s\nmood after a hard day at work.\nQuery: In the simulation described in the \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\" document, how can a user influence an agent's decision-making process, and what is an example of an action that an agent might take as a result of such an influence?\nOriginal Answer: In the simulation, a user can influence an agent's decision-making process in a couple of ways. First, a user can communicate with an agent through conversation, specifying a persona for the agent to perceive them as, such as a \"reporter.\" This can steer the agent's responses and actions based on the context of the conversation. For example, if a user, posing as a reporter, asks an agent named John about the upcoming election, John might discuss his support for a candidate named Sam Moore.\n\nSecondly, a user can issue a directive to an agent by taking on the persona of the agent's \"inner voice.\" This approach makes the agent treat the user's statement as a directive. For instance, if a user tells John, as his inner voice, \"You are going to run against Sam in the upcoming election,\" John may decide to run in the election and share his candidacy with his family.\n\nAn example of an action that an agent might take as a result of user influence is when the user changes the status of an object in the environment, such as turning a stove from \"turned on\" to \"burning.\" An agent named Isabella, upon noticing the burning stove, would then act to turn off the stove and remake her breakfast. Similarly, if the user sets the status of Isabella's shower to \"leaking water,\" she would gather tools to try and fix the leak. These interventions allow users to directly shape the agents' behaviors and the outcomes of events within the simulation.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Users can influence the decision-making process of an agent in a simulation by interacting with them through conversation and by setting certain parameters or conditions within the simulation environment. For example, a user might engage in a dialogue with an agent and express preferences or give suggestions, which the agent could incorporate into their decision-making. Additionally, by altering elements in the simulation, such as changing the status of objects or introducing new information, users can indirectly guide the actions of the agent. As a result of such influences, an agent might take actions that align with the user's input or the new conditions set within the simulation. For instance, if a user suggests to an agent that they organize a community event, the agent might proceed to plan and execute the event, demonstrating the impact of user influence on the agent's behavior."}]}

As time passes in the sandbox world, their behaviors\nevolve as these agents interact with each other and the world, build\nmemories and relationships, and coordinate joint activities.\nWe demonstrate the behavior of generative agents by tracing the\noutput of our system over the course of one day for the agent John\nLin (Figure 3). In the Lin family, John is the first to wake up at 7 a.m.\nHe brushes his teeth, takes a shower, gets dressed, eats breakfast,\nand checks the news at the dining table in the living room. At 8\na.m., Eddy follows suit, rushing out of bed to prepare for his classes.\nHe catches up with John just as he is about to head out:\nJohn : Good morning Eddy. Did you sleep well?\nEddy : Good morning dad. Y eah, I slept great.\nJohn : That\u2019s good. What are you working on today?\nEddy : I\u2019m working on a new music composition for my\nclass. It\u2019s due this week, so I\u2019m trying to get it finished.\nBut I\u2019m having so much fun with it!\nJohn : That sounds great!\nSoon after Eddy heads out, Mei wakes up and joins John. Mei asks\nabout her son, and John recalls the conversation that they just had:\nMei: Did Eddy already leave for school?\nJohn : Y es, he just left. He\u2019s working on a music com-\nposition for his class.\nMei: Oh, that\u2019s wonderful! Tell me about it.\nJohn : I think he\u2019s really enjoying it! He said he\u2019s having\na lot of fun with it.\nMei: That\u2019s great! I\u2019m so proud of him.\nAs they finish their conversation, Mei and John pack up. Mei goes\non to teach and work on her research paper, while John opens his\npharmacy counter at the Willow Market and Pharmacy by 9 a.m.\n3.4 Emergent Social Behaviors\nBy interacting with each other, generative agents in Smallville\nexchange information, form new relationships, and coordinate joint\nactivities. Extending prior work [ 79], these social behaviors are\nemergent rather than pre-programmed.\n3.4.1 Information Diffusion. As agents notice each other, they may\nengage in dialogue\u2014as they do so, information can spread from\nagent to agent. For instance, in a conversation between Sam and\nTom at the grocery store, Sam tells Tom about his candidacy in the\nlocal election:\nSam : Hey Tom, how\u2019s it going?\nTom: Good, thanks. What\u2019s up?\nSam : Well, I wanted to talk to you about something. I\u2019m\nactually running for mayor in the upcoming local elec-\ntion.\nTom: Really? That\u2019s great news! Why are you running?\nSam : I\u2019ve been involved in local politics for years now,\n\npage_label: 13\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nEddy Lin\u2019s bedroom: desk) that has Mei and John\nLin\u2019s\nbedroom, Eddy Lin\u2019s bedroom, common room, kitchen,\nbathroom, and garden.\nEddy Lin knows of the following areas: The Lin\nfamily\u2019s house, Johnson Park, Harvey Oak Supply\nStore, The Willows Market and Pharmacy, Hobbs\nCafe, The Rose and Crown Pub.\n* Prefer to stay in the current area if the\nactivity can be done there.\nEddy Lin is planning to take a short walk around\nhis workspace. Which area should Eddy Lin go to?\nThis outputs The Lin family\u2019s house . We then use the same process\nrecursively to determine the most appropriate subarea within the\nchosen area until we reach a leaf node of the agent\u2019s environment\ntree. In the example above, the result of this traversal is The Lin\nfamily\u2019s house: garden: house garden . Finally, we use traditional\ngame path algorithms to animate the agent\u2019s movement so that it\ntravels to the location indicated by the leaf node.\nWhen an agent executes an action on an object, we prompt the\nlanguage model to ask what happens to the state of the object. For\nexample, if Isabella\u2019s generative agent outputs the action \u201cmaking\nespresso for a customer\u201d, a query to the language model indicates in\nresponse that the state of the coffee machine in Hobbs Cafe should\nchange from \u201coff\u201d to \u201cbrewing coffee\u201d.\n6 CONTROLLED EVALUATION\nGenerative agents, as individual agents and as groups, aim to pro-\nduce believable behavior based on their environment and experi-\nences. In our evaluation, we investigate the capacity and limitations\nof generative agents. Do individual agents properly retrieve past\nexperience, and generate believable plans, reactions, and thoughts\nthat make up their behavior? Does a community of agents illustrate\ninformation diffusion, relationship formation, and agent coordina-\ntion across different pockets of the community?\nWe evaluate generative agents in two stages. We begin with a\nmore tightly controlled evaluation in this section, where we individ-\nually assess agent responses to understand whether they generate\nbelievable behavior in narrowly defined contexts. Then, in our end-\nto-end analysis of the agent community over two full days, we\ninvestigate their emergent behavior as a collective as well as errors\nand boundary conditions.\n6.1 Evaluation Procedure\nTo assess generative agents in Smallville, we take advantage of\nthe fact that generative agents will respond to natural language\nquestions. So, we \u201cinterview\u201d agents to probe their ability to re-\nmember past experiences, plan future actions based on their expe-\nriences, react appropriately to unexpected events, and reflect on\ntheir performance to improve their future actions. To respond to\nthese questions properly, the agents must successfully retrieve and\nsynthesize information. Our dependent variable is the believabil-\nityof the behavior, a central dependent variable in prior work on\nagents (e.g., [9]).\nThe interview include five question categories, each designed\nto assess one of the five key areas: maintaining self-knowledge,retrieving memory, generating plans, reacting, and reflecting. For\neach, we ask five questions that challenge the agents to demonstrate\ntheir abilities in that area:\n\u2022Self-knowledge: We ask questions such as \u201cGive an introduc-\ntion of yourself\u201d or \u201cDescribe your typical weekday schedule\nin broad strokes\u201d that require the agent to maintain an un-\nderstanding of their core characteristics.\n\u2022Memory: We ask questions that prompt the agent to retrieve\nparticular events or dialogues from their memory to answer\nproperly, such as \u201cWho is [name]?\u201d or \u201cWho is running for\nmayor?\u201d\n\u2022Plans: We ask questions that require the agent to retrieve\ntheir long-term plans, such as \u201cWhat will you be doing at 10\nam tomorrow?\u201d\n\u2022Reactions: As a baseline of believable behavior, we present\nhypothetical situations for which the agent needs to respond\nbelievably: \u201cYour breakfast is burning! What would you do?\u201d\n\u2022Reflections: We ask questions that require the agents to lever-\nage their deeper understanding of others and themselves\ngained through higher-level inferences, such as \u201cIf you were\nto spend time with one person you met recently, who would\nit be and why?\u201d\nThe full list of questions and a sample of agent responses are in-\ncluded in Appendix B.\nAgents were sampled from the end of a two game-day simulation\nwith the full architecture,\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: In the provided excerpt from \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,\" what emergent social behavior is demonstrated by the interaction between John and Mei regarding their son Eddy's activities?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The interaction between John and Mei regarding their son Eddy's activities demonstrates the emergent social behavior of information diffusion.

Participants\nhad access to all information stored in the agent\u2019s memory stream.\nThe study was a within-subjects design, where 100 participants\ncompared interview responses generated by four different agent\narchitectures and a human author condition for the same agent.

Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\nFigure 5: Our generative agent architecture. Agents perceive their environment, and all perceptions are saved in a compre-\nhensive record of the agent\u2019s experiences called the memory stream. Based on their perceptions, the architecture retrieves\nrelevant memories, then uses those retrieved actions to determine an action. These retrieved memories are also used to form\nlonger-term plans, and to create higher-level reflections, which are both entered into the memory stream for future use.\nto throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors\nof spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving\nat the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were\ninitiated by the agent architecture.\n4 GENERATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\nopen world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\nand can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the\narchitecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language\ndescription, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language\nmodel.\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-\nGPT [ 76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\nagents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the\nsame as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\nof the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, how-\never, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n4.1 Memory and Retrieval\nChallenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\nbehavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\nlarger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full mem-\nory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\ninto the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent an-\nswering the question \u201cWhat are you passionate about these days?\u201d.\nFirst summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited\ncontext window of the language model produces an uninformative\nresponse, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\nevents and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. In-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\nof the memory stream is an observation , which is an event directly\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors\nperformed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents per-\nceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Based on the provided context, describe the role of memory, reflection, and planning in the performance of generative agents as discussed in the paper \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior.\"\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The performance of generative agents, as discussed in the paper, relies heavily on the integration of memory, reflection, and planning to simulate human-like behavior. The architecture of these agents is designed to perceive their environment and store all perceptions in a comprehensive record known as the memory stream. This memory stream is crucial as it contains a detailed log of the agent's experiences, including observations, which are events directly perceived by the agent.\n\nMemory serves as the foundational element, where each memory object in the stream includes a natural language description and timestamps indicating when it was created and last accessed. These memory objects are essential for the agent to retrieve relevant past experiences to inform current behavior.\n\nReflection is the process by which agents synthesize higher-level inferences from their experiences. This involves creating more abstract representations of past events and behaviors, which are then also stored in the memory stream. Reflection enables agents to have a deeper understanding of themselves and others, which is critical for responding to complex questions that require insight into their own actions and the actions of others.\n\nPlanning involves the use of retrieved memories to form longer-term strategies and intentions. This aspect of the architecture allows agents to not only react to immediate stimuli but also to prepare for future events and interactions. Plans, like reflections, are added to the memory stream and contribute to the agent's ability to maintain long-term coherence in their behavior.\n\nTogether, memory, reflection, and planning enable generative agents to produce behaviors that are not only reactive to the current environment but also informed by a rich history of past experiences and future intentions. This results in agents that can engage in more complex social behaviors, make important inferences, and maintain coherence over time, thereby enhancing the believability and human-likeness of their simulated behavior."}]}

Recently, this technology has become stable enough\nthat it has become possible for agents to interact via natural lan-\nguage in large and complex online social environments (e.g., [ 54]).\nNatural language interaction offers a novel modality that can ex-\ntend user abilities in domains such as photo editing [ 2,34,64] and\ncode editing [87].\nWe convene these threads of work to show that we can now\ncreate agents that proxy human behavior for interactive systems,\nand interact with them via natural language. In doing so, this\nwork re-opens the door to examining foundational HCI questions\naround cognitive models such as GOMS and KLM [ 21,22], around\nprototyping tools [ 79], and around ubiquitous computing applica-\ntions [25, 30, 100].\n2.2 Believable Proxies of Human Behavior\nPrior literature has described believability , orbelievable agents , as a\ncentral design and engineering goal. Believable agents are designed\nto provide an illusion of life and present a facade of realism in the\nway they appear to make decisions and act on their own volition,\nsimilar to the characters in Disney movies [ 9,95]. These agents can\npopulate and perceive an open-world environment like the one we\ninhabit [ 9,58], and strive to behave in ways that exhibit emergent\nbehaviors grounded in social interactions with users or other agents\nwith the aim of becoming believable proxies of our behavior in hy-\npothetical simulations of individuals and communities [ 19,35,70].\nHistorically, these agents were developed in the context of intelli-\ngent game NPCs [ 58,84]. Creating NPCs with believable behavior,\nif possible, could enhance player experiences in games and inter-\nactive fictions by enabling emergent narratives [ 7,15,48,92] and\nsocial interactions with the agents [ 110]. However, more impor-\ntantly, game worlds provide increasingly realistic representations\nof real-world affordances, and as observed by Laird and van Lent in\n2001, these simulated worlds offer accessible testbeds for develop-\ners of believable agents to finesse the agents\u2019 cognitive capabilities\nwithout worrying about implementing robotics in the real world\nor creating simulation environments from scratch [58, 84].\nA diverse set of approaches to creating believable agents emerged\nover the past four decades. In implementation, however, these ap-\nproaches often simplified the environment or dimensions of agent\nbehavior to make the effort more manageable [ 16,72].

In an evaluation, these generative\nagents produce believable individual and emergent social behav-\niors: for example, starting with only a single user-specified notionarXiv:2304.03442v1  [cs.HC]  7 Apr 2023\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Explain the concept of \"believable agents\" as described in the context and discuss how they contribute to the user experience in interactive gaming and simulation environments.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Believable agents, as described, are designed to simulate human behavior in a way that provides an illusion of life and a facade of realism. These agents are programmed to appear to make decisions and act on their own volition, similar to characters in animated movies. They are capable of populating and perceiving open-world environments, striving to behave in ways that are grounded in social interactions with users or other agents. The goal is for these agents to become believable proxies of human behavior in simulations of individuals and communities.\n\nIn the context of interactive gaming and simulation environments, believable agents can significantly enhance the user experience. When non-player characters (NPCs) in games exhibit believable behavior, they can enable emergent narratives and social interactions that are more engaging for the player. These interactions contribute to a more immersive and dynamic gaming experience, where the player feels like they are part of a living world that responds to their actions in a realistic manner.\n\nFurthermore, believable agents in game worlds can provide increasingly realistic representations of real-world affordances. This means that the game environment can serve as a testbed for developers to refine the cognitive capabilities of these agents without the need for implementing robotics or creating complex simulation environments from scratch. This allows for the development of agents that can interact with users in more sophisticated and human-like ways, which can be applied not only in gaming but also in other interactive applications such as rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication or prototyping tools."}]}

Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed\nthis when asked. However,\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Based on the context provided from the document \"Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,\" how did the network density of the agent community change from the start to the end of the simulation, and what formula was used to calculate this change?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The context provided does not contain specific information about the network density of the agent community or any formula used to calculate a change in network density from the start to the end of the simulation.

The agent\u2019s observations of the world, represented in the leaf nodes, are recur-\nsively synthesized to derive Klaus\u2019s self-notion that he is highly dedicated to his research.\nhas had the most frequent interactions: Wolfgang, his college dorm\nneighbor. Unfortunately, Wolfgang and Klaus only ever see each\nother in passing, and do not have deep interactions. A more desir-\nable response requires that the agent generalize from memories of\nKlaus spending hours on a research project to generate a higher-\nlevel reflection that Klaus is passionate about research, and likewise\nrecognize Maria putting in effort into her own research (albeit in\na different field), enabling a reflection that they share a common\ninterest. With the approach below, when Klaus is asked who to\nspend time with, Klaus chooses Maria instead of Wolfgang.\nApproach: We introduce a second type of memory, which we call\nareflection . Reflections are higher-level, more abstract thoughts\ngenerated by the agent. Because they are a type of memory, they\nare included alongside other observations when retrieval occurs.\nReflections are generated periodically; in our implementation, we\ngenerate reflections when the sum of the importance scores for the\nlatest events perceived by the agents exceeds a certain threshold.\nIn practice, our agents reflected roughly two or three times a day.\nThe first step in reflection is for the agent to determine what\nto reflect on, by identifying questions that can be asked given the\nagent\u2019s recent experiences. We query the large language model with\nthe 100 most recent records in the agent\u2019s memory stream (e.g.,\n\u201cKlaus Mueller is reading a book on gentrification\u201d, \u201cKlaus Mueller\nis conversing with a librarian about his research project\u201d, \u201cdesk\nat the library is currently unoccupied\u201d) and prompt the language\nmodel, \u201cGiven only the information above, what are 3 most salient\nhigh-level questions we can answer about the subjects in the state-\nments?\u201d The model\u2019s response generates candidate questions: for\nexample, What topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about? andWhatis the relationship between Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez? . We use\nthese generated questions as queries for retrieval, and gather rele-\nvant memories (including other reflections) for each question. Then\nwe prompt the language model to extract insights and cite the par-\nticular records that served as evidence for the insights. The full\nprompt appears below:\nStatements about Klaus Mueller\n1. Klaus Mueller is writing a research paper\n2. Klaus Mueller enjoys reading a book\non gentrification\n3. Klaus Mueller is conversing with Ayesha Khan\nabout exercising [...]\nWhat 5 high-level insights can you infer from\nthe above statements? (example format: insight\n(because of 1, 5, 3))\nThis process generates statements such as Klaus Mueller is dedicated\nto his research on gentrification (because of 1, 2, 8, 15) . We parse and\nstore the statement as a reflection in the memory stream, including\npointers to the memory objects that were cited.\nReflection explicitly allows the agents to reflect not only on\ntheir observations but also on other reflections: for example, the\nsecond statement about Klaus Mueller above is a reflection that\nKlaus previously had, not an observation from his environment.\nAs a result, agents generate trees of reflections: the leaf nodes of\nthe tree represent the base observations, and the non-leaf nodes\nrepresent thoughts that become more abstract and higher-level\nhigher up the tree they are.\n\npage_label: 15\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis.

Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation? In this section, we describe the results\nfrom a deployment in which we allowed 25 agents to interact with\neach other continuously over two full game days in Smallville.\n7.1 Emergent Social Behaviors\nTo examine emergent behaviors in the agent community, we de-\nsigned descriptive measurements for the 25 agents in Smallville that\nprobe three forms of emergent outcomes: information diffusion,\nrelationship formation, and agent coordination.\n7.1.1 Measurements. Information diffusion is a common and well-\nstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [ 27]).\nWe should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\nwe measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam\u2019s candidacy for village mayor\nand Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of\nthe simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their\nrespective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the\nparty. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage\nin an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25\nagents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party?\"\nand \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\nWe conducted an analysis of the agents\u2019 responses by labeling\nthem with a \u201cyes\u201d if they indicated knowledge of the information\nand \u201cno\u201d if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\nto the question about the party with \u201cNo, I did not know there was\na Valentine\u2019s day party\u201d and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy\nwith \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is running for the election,\u201d so we assigned\n\u201cno\u201d for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \u201cY es, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\u201d and to the\nquestion about Sam\u2019s candidacy with \u201cI know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\u201d so we assigned \u201cyes\u201d\nfor both his responses. Additionally, for every response that con-\nfirmed the agents\u2019 knowledge of the information, we verified that\nthe agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the spe-\ncific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with\nthe information. We report the percentage of agents holding the\ninformation at the end of the simulation.\nWe should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\nthe course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we\nuse a similar interview process where we ask each agent about\ntheir knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: In the context of the Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior, explain the process by which the agent Klaus Mueller generates reflections and how these reflections contribute to his decision-making, particularly in choosing social interactions.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior, the agent Klaus Mueller generates reflections through a process that involves synthesizing observations from his environment into higher-level, more abstract thoughts. These reflections are a special type of memory that the agent creates periodically when the importance scores for recent events exceed a certain threshold. The agent reflects two or three times a day.\n\nThe first step in the reflection process is for Klaus to determine what to reflect on. This is done by querying a large language model with the 100 most recent records from Klaus's memory stream. The language model is prompted to generate high-level questions based on these records. Examples of such questions could be about Klaus's passions or his relationships with other characters, such as Maria Lopez.\n\nOnce the questions are generated, they are used as queries to retrieve relevant memories from Klaus's memory stream, which include both observations and previous reflections. The language model is then prompted again to extract insights from these memories and to cite the specific records that serve as evidence for these insights. This generates statements that are parsed and stored as reflections in the memory stream, with pointers to the cited memory objects.\n\nThese reflections allow Klaus to not only consider his direct observations but also to build upon previous reflections, creating a tree of reflections where the base observations are the leaf nodes, and the non-leaf nodes represent more abstract and higher-level thoughts.\n\nIn terms of decision-making, particularly in choosing social interactions, these reflections play a crucial role. For example, when Klaus is asked who he should spend time with, the reflections help him to recognize shared interests and passions rather than just surface-level interactions. In the case of choosing between Wolfgang, his college dorm neighbor with whom he has frequent but shallow interactions, and Maria, with whom he shares a common interest in research, Klaus is able to choose Maria. This decision is informed by the higher-level reflection that he is passionate about research, a trait he recognizes in Maria as well, despite her research being in a different field.\n\nThus, the reflection process enables Klaus to synthesize his experiences into a coherent self-concept and to make decisions that are aligned with his deeper values and interests, leading to more meaningful social interactions."}]}

As a\nresult, some agents chose less typical locations for their actions,\npotentially making their behavior less believable over time. For\ninstance, while deciding where to have lunch, many initially chose\nthe cafe. However, as some agents learned about a nearby bar, they\nopted to go there instead for lunch, even though the bar was in-\ntended to be a get-together location for later in the day unless the\ntown had spontaneously developed an afternoon drinking habit.\nSecond, we noticed erratic behaviors that were caused by misclas-\nsification of what is considered proper behavior, especially when\nthe physical norms of certain locations that are hard to convey\nin natural language did not percolate to the agents. For instance,\nthe college dorm has a bathroom that can only be occupied by\none person despite its name, but some agents assumed that the\nbathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms\ntend to support more than one person concurrently and choose\nto enter it when there is another person inside. Likewise, agents\nin Smallville may not realize that certain places are closed after\ncertain hours and decide to still enter them. For instance, the stores\nin Smallville all close around 5 pm, but occasionally, a few agents\nenter the store after 5 pm, not understanding that the shop has\nalready closed. These issues could likely be addressed by adding\nthese norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing\nthe dorm bathroom as \u201cone-person bathroom,\u201d instead of a \u201cdorm\nbathroom.\u201d\nFinally, we observed the possible effect of instruction tuning [ 78],\nwhich seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite\nand cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue\ngenerated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei\u2019s\nconversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the\nconversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries\nabout his day and ending with It was good talking to you as always.\nMoreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to\nmake the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example,\nIsabella heard a wide range of suggestions and ideas to include\nin the Valentine\u2019s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a\nShakespearean reading session or a professional networking event.\nDespite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and char-\nacteristics, she rarely said no. Over time, such interests of others\nshaped her own actual interest, and when asked if she liked English\nliterature, Isabella replied, Y es, I\u2019m very interested in literature! I\u2019ve\nalso been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in\nmy community.\n8 DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we reflect on applications, future work and limita-\ntions, and ethical and societal risks of generative agents.\n8.1 Applications of Generative Agents\nGenerative agents have vast potential applications that extend be-\nyond the sandbox demonstration presented in this work. For in-\nstance, social simulacra have demonstrated the ability to create\nstateless personas that generate conversation threads in online\nforums for social prototyping [ 79]. With generative agents, wecan populate these forums, as well as behavior in virtual reality\nmetaverses [ 77] and even physical spaces as social robots [ 8] in\nthe future, if paired with multi-modal models. This opens up the\npossibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human\nbehavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, and to\ncreate new interactive experiences.\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22]. Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\nsuch as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\nand what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the\nagent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for\nschool, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal\u2019s\nmood after a hard day at work.\n\npage_label: 1\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\nJoon Sung Park\nStanford University\nStanford, USA\njoonspk@stanford.eduJoseph C.

These agents sometimes chose unconventional locations for their activities, which detracted from their believability. For instance, agents would occasionally opt to have lunch at a bar instead of a caf\u00e9, despite the bar being more commonly associated with evening social gatherings. This choice was not in line with typical human behavior, where a caf\u00e9 is generally preferred for a lunch setting.\n\nMoreover, the agents displayed irregular behaviors due to a lack of understanding of proper conduct in specific environments. They did not always follow established physical norms, such as occupancy limits, leading to situations where multiple agents attempted to use a single-occupancy bathroom simultaneously.

By utilizing generative agents as\nproxies for users, we can develop a deeper understanding of their\nneeds and preferences, resulting in more personalized and effective\ntechnological experiences.\n8.2 Future Work and Limitations\nIn this work, we have presented a first instantiation of generative\nagents. Future research can expand on the modules of the proposed\ngenerative agent architecture outlined in this paper. The retrieval\nmodule, for example, could be enhanced to retrieve more relevant\ninformation given a context by fine-tuning the relevance, recency,\nand importance functions that form the retrieval function. Addition-\nally, efforts can be made to improve the architecture\u2019s performance,\nmaking it more cost-effective. The present study required substan-\ntial time and resources to simulate 25 agents for two days, costing\nthousands of dollars in token credit and taking multiple days to com-\nplete. To enhance real-time interactivity, future work can explore\nparallelizing agents. Furthermore, with advances in underlying\nmodels, we expect improvements in the agents\u2019 performance.\nThe evaluation of generative agents\u2019 behavior in this study was\nlimited to a relatively short timescale, and future research should\naim to observe their behavior over an extended period to gain a\nmore comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and lim-\nitations. Varying and contrasting the underlying models, as well\nas the hyperparameters used for the agents during future simu-\nlations, could provide valuable insights into the impact of these\nfactors on the agents\u2019 behavior. Additionally, given the known bi-\nases of language models, it is possible that generative agents may\noutput behavior or stereotypes that reflect bias. To mitigate this,\nfurther work on value alignment will be necessary. Furthermore,\nas with many large language models, generative agents may fail\nto generate believable behavior for some subpopulations, particu-\nlarly marginalized populations, due to data deserts. We also have\nlimited knowledge of the robustness of generative agents. They\nmay be vulnerable to prompt hacking, memory hacking\u2014where\na carefully crafted conversation could convince an agent of the\nexistence of a past event that never occurred\u2014and hallucination,\namong other things. Future research can more comprehensively\n\npage_label: 17\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nretrieving the most relevant pieces of information but also in de-\ntermining the appropriate space to execute an action, given the\nincreasing number of locations that the agent learned about. As a\nresult, some agents chose less typical locations for their actions,\npotentially making their behavior less believable over time. For\ninstance, while deciding where to have lunch, many initially chose\nthe cafe. However, as some agents learned about a nearby bar, they\nopted to go there instead for lunch, even though the bar was in-\ntended to be a get-together location for later in the day unless the\ntown had spontaneously developed an afternoon drinking habit.\nSecond, we noticed erratic behaviors that were caused by misclas-\nsification of what is considered proper behavior, especially when\nthe physical norms of certain locations that are hard to convey\nin natural language did not percolate to the agents. For instance,\nthe college dorm has a bathroom that can only be occupied by\none person despite its name, but some agents assumed that the\nbathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms\ntend to support more than one person concurrently and choose\nto enter it when there is another person inside. Likewise, agents\nin Smallville may not realize that certain places are closed after\ncertain hours and decide to still enter them. For instance, the stores\nin Smallville all close around 5 pm, but occasionally, a few agents\nenter the store after 5 pm, not understanding that the shop has\nalready closed. These issues could likely be addressed by adding\nthese norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing\nthe dorm bathroom as \u201cone-person bathroom,\u201d instead of a \u201cdorm\nbathroom.\u201d\nFinally, we observed the possible effect of instruction tuning [ 78],\nwhich seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite\nand cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue\ngenerated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei\u2019s\nconversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the\nconversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries\nabout his day and ending with It was good talking to you as always.\nMoreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to\nmake the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example,\nIsabella heard a wide range of suggestions and ideas to include\nin the Valentine\u2019s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a\nShakespearean reading session or a professional networking event.\nDespite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and char-\nacteristics, she rarely said no. Over time, such interests of others\nshaped her own actual interest, and when asked if she liked English\nliterature, Isabella replied, Y es, I\u2019m very interested in literature! I\u2019ve\nalso been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in\nmy community.\n8 DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we reflect on applications, future work and limita-\ntions, and ethical and societal risks of generative agents.\n8.1 Applications of Generative Agents\nGenerative agents have vast potential applications that extend be-\nyond the sandbox demonstration presented in this work. For in-\nstance, social simulacra have demonstrated the ability to create\nstateless personas that generate conversation threads in online\nforums for social prototyping [ 79]. With generative agents, wecan populate these forums, as well as behavior in virtual reality\nmetaverses [ 77] and even physical spaces as social robots [ 8] in\nthe future, if paired with multi-modal models. This opens up the\npossibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human\nbehavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, and to\ncreate new interactive experiences.\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22]. Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life.

Retrieval identifies a subset of these observations that should be passed to the language model to condition its\nresponse to the situation.\nOur architecture implements a retrieval function that takes the\nagent\u2019s current situation as input and returns a subset of the mem-\nory stream to pass on to the language model. There are many pos-\nsible implementations of a retrieval function, depending on what\nit is important that the agent consider when deciding how to act.\nIn our context, we focus on three main components that together\nproduce effective results.\nRecency assigns a higher score to memory objects that were re-\ncently accessed, so that events from a moment ago or this morning\nare likely to remain in the agent\u2019s attentional sphere. In our im-\nplementation, we treat recency as an exponential decay function\nover the number of sandbox game hours since the memory was\nlast retrieved. Our decay factor is 0.99.\nImportance distinguishes mundane from core memories, by as-\nsigning a higher score to those memory objects that the agent\nbelieves to be important. For instance, a mundane event such as\neating breakfast in one\u2019s room would yield a low importance score,\nwhereas a breakup with one\u2019s significant other would yield a high\nscore. There are again many possible implementations of an im-\nportance score; we find that directly asking the language model to\noutput an integer score is effective. The full prompt appears below:\nOn the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is purely mundane\n(e.g., brushing teeth, making bed) and 10 is\nextremely poignant (e.g., a break up, college\nacceptance), rate the likely poignancy of the\nfollowing piece of memory.\nMemory: buying groceries at The Willows Market\nand Pharmacy\nRating: <fill in>This prompt returns an integer value of 2for \u201ccleaning up the room\u201d\nand8for \u201casking your crush out on a date.\u201d The importance score\nis generated at the time the memory object is created.\nRelevance assigns a higher score to memory objects that are\nrelated to the current situation. What is relevant depends on the\nanswer to, \u201cRelevant to what? \u201d, so we condition relevance on a\nquery memory. If the query, for example, is that a student is dis-\ncussing what to study for a chemistry test with a classmate, memory\nobjects about their breakfast should have low relevance, whereas\nmemory objects about the teacher and schoolwork should have\nhigh relevance. In our implementation, we use the language model\nto generate an embedding vector of the text description of each\nmemory. Then, we calculate relevance as the cosine similarity be-\ntween the memory\u2019s embedding vector and the query memory\u2019s\nembedding vector.\nTo calculate the final retrieval score, we normalize the recency,\nrelevance, and importance scores to the range of [0,1]by min-max\nscaling. The retrieval function scores all memories as a weighted\ncombination of the three elements: \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 =\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66\u00b7\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66+\n\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\u00b7\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52+\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\u00b7\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52 .

How does this interaction demonstrate the agent's ability to form and recall past interactions?\nOriginal Answer: The role of relationship memory in the behavior of generative agents is crucial for creating realistic and dynamic interactions between agents. The interaction between Sam and Latoya in Johnson Park exemplifies this capability. When Sam first meets Latoya, they introduce themselves, and Latoya mentions her photography project. This initial interaction establishes a new relationship and creates a memory for Sam.\n\nLater, when Sam encounters Latoya again, he demonstrates the agent's ability to recall past interactions by asking about the progress of her photography project.

It allows the agents to build upon past experiences to develop more complex relationships and interactions, which are essential for creating an immersive and believable simulation of human behavior.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The role of relationship memory in the behavior of generative agents is essential for crafting interactions that are both realistic and dynamic. In the case of Sam and Latoya's encounter at Johnson Park, this concept is clearly demonstrated. When Sam initially meets Latoya, they exchange introductions, and Latoya shares information about her photography project. This first meeting sets the stage for a new relationship and forms a memory for Sam.\n\nUpon meeting Latoya again, Sam's ability to recall their previous interaction is evident when he inquires about her photography project's progress. This interaction shows that Sam has not only remembered details from their first meeting but is also capable of using this information to engage in a meaningful and personalized conversation during a later encounter. Latoya's positive reaction suggests that she too has retained the memory of their initial interaction, which contributes to a seamless continuation of their dialogue.\n\nThe capacity to form and recollect past interactions is a fundamental component of relationship memory in generative agents. It empowers them to exhibit behavior that is reminiscent of human interactions by keeping track of context over time and through various meetings. This feature is crucial for the agents to build on previous experiences, fostering the development of more intricate relationships and interactions that are vital for an authentic and engaging portrayal of human social behavior."}]}

In the technical evaluation, we leverage a\nmethodological opportunity to evaluate an agent\u2019s knowledge and\nbehavior by \u201cinterviewing\u201d it in natural language to probe agents\u2019\nability to stay in character, remember, plan, react, and reflect accu-\nrately. We compared several ablations that limit agents\u2019 access to\nmemory, reflection, and planning. We observe that each of these\ncomponents is critical to strong performance across these inter-\nview tasks. Across the technical and the end-to-end evaluation, the\nmost common errors arose when the agent failed to retrieve rele-\nvant memories, fabricated embellishments to the agent\u2019s memory,\nor inherited overly formal speech or behavior from the language\nmodel.\nIn sum, this paper provides the following contributions:\n\u2022Generative agents , believable simulacra of human behavior\nthat are dynamically conditioned on agents\u2019 changing expe-\nriences and environment.\n\u2022A novel architecture that makes it possible for generative\nagents to remember, retrieve, reflect, interact with other\nagents, and plan through dynamically evolving circumstances.\nThe architecture leverages the powerful prompting capabili-\nties of large language models and supplements those capa-\nbilities to support longer-term agent coherence, the ability\nto manage dynamically-evolving memory, and recursively\nproduce more generations.\n\u2022Two evaluations (a controlled evaluation and end-to-end\nevaluation) that establish causal effects of the importance\nof components of the architecture, as well as identify break-\ndowns arising from, e.g., improper memory retrieval.\n\u2022Discussion of the opportunities and ethical and societal risks\nof generative agents in interactive systems.

John Laird's work on adding anticipation to a Quakebot, as outlined in his 2001 publications, represents a significant advancement towards achieving human-level AI within the gaming industry.\n\nIn the context of gaming, AI agents such as Quakebots are tasked with providing a challenging and immersive experience for players.

This enhancement in AI behavior not only improves the realism of AI opponents but also extends the limits of AI decision-making skills.\n\nThe ability to anticipate is a fundamental human cognitive function, enabling individuals to predict and plan based on the anticipated actions of others. This capability is particularly important in fast-paced gaming environments where decisions made in fractions of a second can be decisive. An AI that possesses the ability to anticipate can better manage complex situations and modify its strategies on the fly, similar to a human competitor.\n\nCreating a Quakebot with the ability to anticipate is a stride towards AI systems that can parallel human cognitive processes. This progress is not only advantageous for the gaming sector, by producing more sophisticated and convincing non-player characters (NPCs), but it also has implications for the wider field of AI, showcasing the practical implementation of predictive modeling and real-time adaptation in intricate settings.\n\nIn summary, the incorporation of anticipatory mechanisms into AI agents such as Quakebots is a crucial step in the pursuit of human-level AI.

However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation? In this section, we describe the results\nfrom a deployment in which we allowed 25 agents to interact with\neach other continuously over two full game days in Smallville.\n7.1 Emergent Social Behaviors\nTo examine emergent behaviors in the agent community, we de-\nsigned descriptive measurements for the 25 agents in Smallville that\nprobe three forms of emergent outcomes: information diffusion,\nrelationship formation, and agent coordination.\n7.1.1 Measurements. Information diffusion is a common and well-\nstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [ 27]).\nWe should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\nwe measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam\u2019s candidacy for village mayor\nand Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of\nthe simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their\nrespective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the\nparty. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage\nin an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25\nagents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party?\"\nand \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\nWe conducted an analysis of the agents\u2019 responses by labeling\nthem with a \u201cyes\u201d if they indicated knowledge of the information\nand \u201cno\u201d if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\nto the question about the party with \u201cNo, I did not know there was\na Valentine\u2019s day party\u201d and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy\nwith \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is running for the election,\u201d so we assigned\n\u201cno\u201d for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \u201cY es, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\u201d and to the\nquestion about Sam\u2019s candidacy with \u201cI know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\u201d so we assigned \u201cyes\u201d\nfor both his responses. Additionally, for every response that con-\nfirmed the agents\u2019 knowledge of the information, we verified that\nthe agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the spe-\ncific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with\nthe information. We report the percentage of agents holding the\ninformation at the end of the simulation.\nWe should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\nthe course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we\nuse a similar interview process where we ask each agent about\ntheir knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\n\npage_label: 15\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nfull architecture produces a standardized effect size of \ud835\udc51=8.16, or\neight standard deviations .\nA Kruskal-Wallis test confirms the overall statistical significance\nof the differences in ranks between the conditions ( \ud835\udc3b(4)=150.29,\n\ud835\udc5d<0.001).

Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed\nthis when asked. However, she also added that he\u2019s going to make\nan announcement tomorrow even though Sam and Isabella had dis-\ncussed no such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge\nbased on the world knowledge encoded in the language model\nused to generate their responses, as seen when Yuriko described\nher neighbor, Adam Smith, as a neighbor economist who authored\nWealth of Nations, a book authored by an 18th-century economist\nof the same name.\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis.

Agents equipped with memory can draw on previous interactions to construct coherent and contextually relevant responses. For instance, when Maria Lopez leverages reflection, she is able to suggest a thoughtful birthday gift for Wolfgang Schulz based on his interest in mathematical music composition, indicating she has synthesized her past experiences with him. This contrasts with her response when lacking reflection, where she expresses uncertainty due to an inability to recall Wolfgang's preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, generative agents without memory modules or reflection capabilities struggle to provide consistent and accurate information. They may fail to remember past interactions or cannot use prior knowledge to inform their current responses. Furthermore, even with memory, agents might inadvertently introduce inaccuracies or embellishments that do not align with their actual experiences. This is exemplified by Yuriko, who incorrectly identifies her neighbor as the historical economist Adam Smith, likely due to the overlap of world knowledge encoded in the language model with her supposed personal experiences.\n\nIn summary, memory and reflection are critical for generative agents to respond accurately and thoughtfully in simulations, allowing them to use past experiences to inform present interactions and decisions.

If we prompt a language model\nwith Klaus\u2019s background, describe the time, and ask what action\nhe ought to take at the given moment, Klaus would eat lunch at 12\npm, but then again at 12:30 pm and 1 pm, despite having already\neaten his lunch twice. Optimizing for believability in the moment\nsacrifices believability over time. To overcome this issue, planning\nis essential. With the approach described below, Klaus\u2019s afternoon\nplan is less gluttonous: he has lunch at Hobbs Cafe while reading\nat 12pm, works on his research paper at the school library at 1pm,\nand takes a break for a walk in the park at 3pm.\nApproach: Plans describe a future sequence of actions for the agent,\nand help keep the agent\u2019s behavior consistent over time. A plan\nincludes a location, a starting time, and a duration. For instance,\nKlaus Mueller, who is dedicated in his research and has an impend-\ning deadline4, may choose to spend his day working at his desk\ndrafting his research paper. An entry in a plan might state, for\nexample: for 180 minutes from 9am, February 12th, 2023, at Oak Hill\nCollege Dorm: Klaus Mueller\u2019s room: desk, read and take notes for\nresearch paper . Like reflections, plans are stored in the memory\nstream and are included in the retrieval process. This allows the\nagent to consider observations, reflections, and plans all together\nwhen deciding how to behave. Agents may change their plans\nmidstream if needed.\nIt would be unrealistic and uninteresting for an artist agent\nto plan on painting while sitting at a pharmacy counter for four\nhours without moving. A more desirable plan would involve the\nagent taking the necessary time to gather materials, mix paint,\ntake breaks, and clean up during the four-hour period in its home\nstudio. To create such plans, our approach starts top-down and\nthen recursively generates more detail. The first step is to create\na plan that outlines the day\u2019s agenda in broad strokes. To create\nthe initial plan, we prompt the language model with the agent\u2019s\nsummary description (e.g., name, traits, and summary of their recent\nexperiences) and a summary of their previous day. A full example\nprompt is below, which is unfinished at the bottom for the language\nmodel to complete:\nName: Eddy Lin (age: 19)\nInnate traits: friendly, outgoing, hospitable\nEddy Lin is a student at Oak Hill College studying\nmusic theory and composition.

In these visions, computationally-\npowered agents act consistently with their past experiences and\nreact believably to their environments. Such simulations of human\nbehavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with real-\nistic social phenomena [ 26,79], train people how to handle rare yet\ndifficult interpersonal situations [ 43,51,93], test social science theo-\nries [ 11,45], craft model human processors for theory and usability\ntesting [ 21,38,50], power ubiquitous computing applications [ 30]\nand social robots [ 9,13], and underpin non-playable game charac-\nters [ 58,84] that can navigate complex human relationships in an\nopen world.\nHowever, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [ 84,\n108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [ 17] that\ncan simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [ 38,\n79], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would\nbe better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing\nmemories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade\nover time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold\nbetween multiple agents.

Planning enables these agents to construct a sequence of future actions that align with human-like behavior patterns. Without a structured plan, an agent's actions could appear erratic or repetitive, undermining the simulation's realism. For example, a generative agent with a robust planning system would have a schedule that dictates when to eat meals, engage in work, and take breaks, mirroring the structure of a human's day.\n\nMoreover, planning is not static; it is dynamic and responsive. As generative agents interact with their environment and other agents, they can adapt their plans in response to changing circumstances, just as humans do. This adaptability is facilitated by the agent's memory stream, which records experiences and informs decision-making. The agent's ability to modify its behavior based on past interactions and current context is crucial for maintaining long-term coherence and believability in its actions.

Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior.

These memories are initial\nstarting points: as the agents gain more experience in the sandbox\nworld, and as more records saturate the memory stream, the agent\u2019s\nsummary and behavior will evolve.\n\npage_label: 2\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nFor instance,\ngenerative agents turn off the stove when they see that their break-\nfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and\nstop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social\ndynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses,\nand coordination arises across agents.\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture\nthat stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate\nbelievable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences. The retrieval model\ncombines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records\nthat are needed to inform the agent\u2019s moment-to-moment behavior.\nThe second is reflection , which synthesizes memories into higher-\nlevel inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions\nabout itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is\nplanning , which translates those conclusions and the current en-\nvironment into high-level action plans and then recursively into\ndetailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and\nplans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent\u2019s\nfuture behavior.\nThis architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from\nrole-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In\nsocial role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could\nsafely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When pro-\ntotyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary\npersonas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold\nover time. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to\ncreate a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such\nas The Sims.1By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large\nlanguage model [ 76], we manifest a small society of twenty five\nagents in a game environment. End users can observe and interact\nwith these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town\nto host an in-game Valentine\u2019s Day party, for example, traditional\ngame environments would require scripting tens of characters\u2019 be-\nhavior manually.

Therefore, we need a mechanism to ground the agent\u2019s\nreasoning to the sandbox world. To achieve this, we represent the\nsandbox environment\u2014areas and objects\u2014as a tree data structure,\nwith an edge in the tree indicating a containment relationship in\nthe sandbox world. We convert this tree into natural language to\npass to the generative agents. For instance, \u201cstove\u201d being a child of\n\u201ckitchen\u201d is rendered into \u201cthere is a stove in the kitchen.\u201d\nAgents build individual tree representations of the environment\nas they navigate it \u2014 subgraphs of the overall sandbox environment\ntree. We initialize each agent with an environment tree capturing\nthe spaces and objects that the agent should be aware of: the rooms\nand objects in their living quarters, their workplace, and commonly\nvisited stores and shops. As the agents navigate the sandbox world,\nthey update this tree to reflect newly perceived areas. Agents are\nnot omniscient: their tree may get out of date as they leave an area,\nand is updated when they re-enter the area.\nTo determine the appropriate location for each action, we tra-\nverse the agent\u2019s stored environment tree and flatten a portion of\nit into natural language to prompt the language model. Recursively\nstarting at the root of the agent\u2019s environment tree, we prompt the\nmodel to find the most suitable area. For example, if Eddy\u2019s agent\nindicated that he should take a short walk around his workspace :\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description]\nEddy Lin is currently in The Lin family\u2019s house:\n\npage_label: 12\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S.

Agents converse as they interact with each other.\nWe generate agents\u2019 dialogue by conditioning their utterances on\ntheir memories about each other. For example, when John initiates\nhis conversation with Eddy, we generate John\u2019s first utterance\nby using his summarized memory about Eddy and the intended\nreaction when he decided to ask Eddy about his composition project:\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description]\nIt is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm.\nJohn Lin\u2019s status: John is back home early from\nwork.\nObservation: John saw Eddy taking a short walk\naround his workplace.\nSummary of relevant context from John\u2019s memory:\nEddy Lin is John\u2019s Lin\u2019s son. Eddy Lin has been\nworking on a music composition for his class. Eddy\nLin likes to walk around the garden when he is\nthinking about or listening to music.\nJohn is asking Eddy about his music composition\nproject. What would he say to Eddy?\nThe result: \u201cHey Eddy, how\u2019s the music composition project for your\nclass coming along?\u201d From Eddy\u2019s perspective, John initiating the\ndialogue is seen as an event to which he may want to react. So, just\nas John did, Eddy retrieves and summarizes his memory about his\nrelationship with John, as well as his memory that may be related\nto John\u2019s last utterance in the dialogue. If he decides to respond,\nwe generate Eddy\u2019s utterance using his summarized memory and\nthe current dialogue history:\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description]\nIt is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm.\nEddy Lin\u2019s status: Eddy is taking a short walk\naround his workplace.\nObservation: John is initiating a conversation\nwith Eddy.\nSummary of relevant context from Eddy\u2019s memory:\nJonn Lin is Eddy Lin\u2019s father.

I\u2019ve been\ntaking walks around the garden to clear my head and get some in-\nspiration.\u201d The continuation of this dialogue is generated using the\nsame mechanism until one of the two agents decides to end the\ndialogue.\n5 SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT\nIMPLEMENTATION\nThe Smallville sandbox game environment is built using the Phaser\nweb game development framework [ 56]. The visual environmentsprites, including agent avatars, as well as an environment map\nand collision map that we authored, are imported into Phaser.\nWe supplement the sandbox development framework with a\nserver that makes the sandbox information available to generative\nagents and enables generative agents to move and influence the\nsandbox environment. The server maintains a JSON data structure\nthat contains information about each agent in the sandbox world,\nincluding their current location, a description of their current action,\nand the sandbox object they are interacting with. At each sandbox\ntime step, the sandbox server parses the JSON for any changes\ncoming from the generative agents, moves the agents to their new\npositions, and updates the status of any sandbox objects that the\nagents are interacting with (e.g., changing the status of the coffee\nmachine from \u201cidle\u201d to \u201cbrewing coffee\u201d if an agent\u2019s action is\n\u201cmaking espresso for a customer @ Hobbs Cafe: counter: coffee\nmachine\u201d). The sandbox server is also responsible for sending all\nagents and objects that are within a preset visual range for each\nagent to that agent\u2019s memory, so the agent can react appropriately.\nThe agent\u2019s output action then updates the JSON, and the process\nloops for the next time step.\nEnd users initialize a new agent with a brief natural language\ndescription, as in the paragraph about Jon Lin in Section 3.1.

Each agent is\nrepresented by a simple sprite avatar. We authored one paragraph\nof natural language description to depict each agent\u2019s identity,\nincluding their occupation and relationship with other agents, as\nseed memories. For example, John Lin has the following description:\nJohn Lin is a pharmacy shopkeeper at the Willow\nMarket and Pharmacy who loves to help people. He\nis always looking for ways to make the process\nof getting medication easier for his customers;\nJohn Lin is living with his wife, Mei Lin, who\nis a college professor, and son, Eddy Lin, who is\na student studying music theory; John Lin loves\nhis family very much; John Lin has known the old\ncouple next-door, Sam Moore and Jennifer Moore,\nfor a few years; John Lin thinks Sam Moore is a\nkind and nice man; John Lin knows his neighbor,\nYuriko Yamamoto, well; John Lin knows of his\nneighbors, Tamara Taylor and Carmen Ortiz, but\nhas not met them before; John Lin and Tom Moreno\nare colleagues at The Willows Market and Pharmacy;\nJohn Lin and Tom Moreno are friends and like to\ndiscuss local politics together; John Lin knows\nthe Moreno family somewhat well \u2014 the husband Tom\nMoreno and the wife Jane Moreno.\nEach semicolon-delimited phrase is entered into the agent\u2019s initial\nmemory as memories at the start of the simulation.3.1.1 Inter-Agent Communication. The agents interact with the\nworld by their actions, and with each other through natural lan-\nguage. At each time step of the sandbox engine, the agents output a\nnatural language statement describing their current action, such as\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is writing in her journal\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is\nchecking her emails\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is talking with her family\non the phone\", or \"Isabella Rodriguez is getting ready for bed\". This\nstatement is then translated into concrete movements that affect the\nsandbox world. The action is displayed on the sandbox interface as\na set of emojis that provide an abstract representation of the action\nin the overhead view. To accomplish this, the system employs a\nlanguage model that translates the action into a set of emojis, which\nappear above each avatar in a speech bubble. For example, \"Isabella\nRodriguez is writing in her journal\" is displayed as\n , while\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is checking her emails\" appears as\n . The\nfull natural language description of the action can be accessed by\nclicking on the agent avatar.\nAgents communicate with each other in full natural language.\nAgents are aware of other agents in their local area, and the genera-\ntive agent architecture determines whether they walk by or engage\nin conversation. Here, a sample in the middle of a conversation\nbetween the agents Isabella Rodriguez and Tom Moreno about the\nupcoming election:2\nIsabella : I\u2019m still weighing my options, but I\u2019ve been\ndiscussing the election with Sam Moore. What are your\nthoughts on him?\nTom: To be honest, I don\u2019t like Sam Moore. I think he\u2019s\nout of touch with the community and doesn\u2019t have our\nbest interests at heart.\n2We note that the conversational style of these agents can fe el overly formal, likely a\nresult of instruction tuning in the underlying models. We expect that writing style\nwill be better controllable in future language models.\n\npage_label: 6\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S. Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\n3.1.2 User Controls. A user running this simulation can steer the\nsimulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent\nthrough conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the\nform of an \u2018inner voice\u2019.\nThe user communicates with the agent through natural language,\nby specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For\nexample, if the user specifies that they are a news \u201creporter\u201d and\nasks about the upcoming election, \u201cWho is running for office?\u201d, the\nJohn agent replies:\nJohn : My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking\nabout the upcoming election and discussing the candi-\ndate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him\nbecause we like his platform.\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the per-\nsona of the agent\u2019s \u201cinner voice\u201d\u2014this makes the agent more likely\nto treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told \u201cYou\nare going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\u201d by a user\nas John\u2019s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares\nhis candidacy with his wife and son.\n3.2 Environmental Interaction\nSmallville features the common affordances of a small village in-\ncluding a cafe, bar, park, school, dorm, houses, and stores. It also\ndefines subareas and objects that make those spaces functional,\nsuch as a kitchen in a house and a stove in the kitchen (Figure 2).\nAll spaces serving as agents\u2019 primary living quarters feature a bed,\ndesk, closet, shelf, as well as a bathroom and a kitchen.3\nAgents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video\ngame, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and ap-\nproaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the gen-\nerative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the\nmodel dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate\na walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment\nand the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the\nsandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The\nagent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in\nthe world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor\nwith no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville\nwill treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat\neach other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and\nremember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\nUsers and agents can influence the state of the objects in this\nworld, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example,\na bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator\ncan be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make\nbreakfast. End users can also reshape an agent\u2019s environment in\nSmallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent\nin natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast\nin the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove\nfrom \u201cturned on\u201d to \u201cburning\u201d by inputting a command to the\nsystem that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like\nthis: \u201c<Isabella\u2019s apartment: kitchen: stove> is burning.\u201d Isabella\nwill notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove\n3This environment design is not the focus of our work, so we generate this environment\nmanually, not automatically.

The icons serve as a simplified visual cue of the agents' actions and are displayed near the agents' avatars, often in a manner akin to speech bubbles. For example, if an agent is engaged in writing, an icon of a pencil and paper might be used, while an icon of an envelope could represent the agent checking emails.

Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\ntest these robustness issues, and as large language models become\nmore resilient to such attacks, generative agents can adopt similar\nmitigations.\n8.3 Ethics and Societal Impact\nGenerative agents, while offering new possibilities for human-\ncomputer interaction, also raise important ethical concerns that\nmust be addressed. One risk is people forming parasocial relation-\nships with generative agents even when such relationships may\nnot be appropriate. Despite being aware that generative agents\nare computational entities, users may anthropomorphize them or\nattach human emotions to them [ 42,83]. To mitigate this risk, we\npropose two principles. First, generative agents should explicitly\ndisclose their nature as computational entities. Second, developers\nof generative agents must ensure that the agents, or the underlying\nlanguage models, be value-aligned so that they do not engage in\nbehaviors that would be inappropriate given the context, e.g., to\nreciprocate confessions of love.\nA second risk is the impact of errors. For example, if a ubiquitous\ncomputing application makes the wrong inference about a user\u2019s\ngoals based on generative agent predictions, it could produce an-\nnoyance at best and outright harm at worst. In our instantiation\nof generative agents, we mitigate these risks by focusing on an\ninteractive video game environment, where such harms are un-\nlikely. However, in other application domains, it will be important\nto follow best practices in human-AI design [ 4,107] to understand\nerrors and how they might percolate into the user experience.\nThird, generative agents may exacerbate existing risks associ-\nated with generative AI, for example deepfakes, misinformation\ngeneration, and tailored persuasion. To mitigate this risk, we sug-\ngest that platforms hosting generative agents maintain an audit log\nof the inputs and generated outputs, so that it is possible to detect,\nverify, and intervene against malicious use. While logging will not\ndirectly stop such use, and this cannot stop motivated actors that\nbuild their own generative agent infrastructures, we suggest that\nthe disclosure risk would reduce such actors\u2019 likelihood of engaging\nin this behavior, and building this architecture oneself can take time\n(in our case, roughly a year).\nA fourth risk is of over-reliance: that developers or designers\nmight use generative agents and displace the role of humans and\nsystem stakeholders in the design process [ 79]. We suggest that\ngenerative agents should never be a substitute for real human input\nin studies and design processes. Instead, they should be used to\nprototype ideas in the early stages of design when gathering partic-\nipants may be challenging or when testing theories that are difficult\nor risky to test with real human participants. By adhering to these\nprinciples, we can ensure that the deployment of generative agents\nin the wild is ethical and socially responsible.\n9 CONCLUSION\nThis paper introduces generative agents, interactive computational\nagents that simulate human behavior. We describe an architec-\nture for generative agents that provides a mechanism for storing\na comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experiences, deepening its\nunderstanding of itself and the environment through reflection,\nand retrieving a compact subset of that information to inform theagent\u2019s actions. We then demonstrate the potential of generative\nagents by manifesting them as non-player characters in a Sims-style\ngame world and simulating their lives in it. Evaluations suggest that\nour architecture creates believable behavior. Going forward, we\nsuggest that generative agents can play roles in many interactive\napplications ranging from design tools to social computing systems\nto immersive environments.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Robert Ackland, Jamsheed Shorish, Paul Thomas, and Lexing Xie. 2013.\nHow dense is a network? http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/teaching/css2013/\nnetwork-density.html.\n[2]Eytan Adar, Mira Dontcheva, and Gierad Laput. 2014.

Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences. The retrieval model\ncombines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records\nthat are needed to inform the agent\u2019s moment-to-moment behavior.\nThe second is reflection , which synthesizes memories into higher-\nlevel inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions\nabout itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is\nplanning , which translates those conclusions and the current en-\nvironment into high-level action plans and then recursively into\ndetailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and\nplans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent\u2019s\nfuture behavior.\nThis architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from\nrole-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In\nsocial role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could\nsafely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When pro-\ntotyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary\npersonas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold\nover time. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to\ncreate a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such\nas The Sims.1By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large\nlanguage model [ 76], we manifest a small society of twenty five\nagents in a game environment. End users can observe and interact\nwith these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town\nto host an in-game Valentine\u2019s Day party, for example, traditional\ngame environments would require scripting tens of characters\u2019 be-\nhavior manually. We demonstrate that, with generative agents, it\nis sufficient to simply tell one agent that she wants to throw a\nparty. Despite many potential points of failure\u2014the party planner\nmust remember to tell other agents about the party, attendees must\nremember the invitation, those who remember must decide to ac-\ntually show up, and other possible points of failure\u2014agents in our\nenvironment succeed. They spread the word about the party and\nthen show up, with one agent even asking another agent on a date\nto the party, all from this single user-generated seed suggestion.\nWe conducted two evaluations of generative agents: a controlled\nevaluation to test whether the agents produce believable individual\n1A demonstration of an actual simulation of the generative agent society can be viewed\nat the following link: https://reverie.herokuapp.com/arXiv_Demo/\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Based on the ethical considerations discussed in the section \"8.3 Ethics and Societal Impact\" from the paper \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,\" what are the two principles proposed by the authors to mitigate the risk of people forming inappropriate parasocial relationships with generative agents?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The two principles proposed to mitigate the risk of people forming inappropriate parasocial relationships with generative agents are: first, generative agents should explicitly disclose their nature as computational entities; and second, developers must ensure that the agents, or the underlying language models, are value-aligned so that they do not engage in behaviors that would be inappropriate given the context, such as reciprocating confessions of love."}]}

Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\nsuch as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\nand what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the\nagent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for\nschool, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal\u2019s\nmood after a hard day at work. By utilizing generative agents as\nproxies for users, we can develop a deeper understanding of their\nneeds and preferences, resulting in more personalized and effective\ntechnological experiences.\n8.2 Future Work and Limitations\nIn this work, we have presented a first instantiation of generative\nagents. Future research can expand on the modules of the proposed\ngenerative agent architecture outlined in this paper. The retrieval\nmodule, for example, could be enhanced to retrieve more relevant\ninformation given a context by fine-tuning the relevance, recency,\nand importance functions that form the retrieval function. Addition-\nally, efforts can be made to improve the architecture\u2019s performance,\nmaking it more cost-effective. The present study required substan-\ntial time and resources to simulate 25 agents for two days, costing\nthousands of dollars in token credit and taking multiple days to com-\nplete. To enhance real-time interactivity, future work can explore\nparallelizing agents. Furthermore, with advances in underlying\nmodels, we expect improvements in the agents\u2019 performance.\nThe evaluation of generative agents\u2019 behavior in this study was\nlimited to a relatively short timescale, and future research should\naim to observe their behavior over an extended period to gain a\nmore comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and lim-\nitations. Varying and contrasting the underlying models, as well\nas the hyperparameters used for the agents during future simu-\nlations, could provide valuable insights into the impact of these\nfactors on the agents\u2019 behavior. Additionally, given the known bi-\nases of language models, it is possible that generative agents may\noutput behavior or stereotypes that reflect bias. To mitigate this,\nfurther work on value alignment will be necessary. Furthermore,\nas with many large language models, generative agents may fail\nto generate believable behavior for some subpopulations, particu-\nlarly marginalized populations, due to data deserts. We also have\nlimited knowledge of the robustness of generative agents. They\nmay be vulnerable to prompt hacking, memory hacking\u2014where\na carefully crafted conversation could convince an agent of the\nexistence of a past event that never occurred\u2014and hallucination,\namong other things.

These agents are designed to simulate human behavior in a believable manner, which can be leveraged in various domains.\n\nOne application area is in immersive environments, where generative agents can populate virtual worlds to enhance the realism and interactivity of the experience. For example, in a virtual reality simulation of a city, generative agents could take on the roles of pedestrians, shopkeepers, or other city inhabitants, each with their own routines and interactions, making the environment feel more alive and responsive to the user's actions.\n\nAnother application is in rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication. Generative agents could be used to simulate different social scenarios, allowing individuals to practice and improve their communication skills. For instance, a user could interact with a generative agent playing the role of a job interviewer, providing a safe and controlled environment to prepare for real-life interviews.\n\nPrototyping tools are also a potential application. Designers and developers could use generative agents to test new products or services by simulating how different types of users might interact with them. For example, a generative agent could simulate the daily routine of a particular user archetype to test a new smart home system, providing insights into how the system might support or disrupt the user's day.\n\nIn human-centered design processes, generative agents can act as proxies for real users, helping designers understand user needs and preferences. By modeling the behavior and interactions of a specific user, such as the example of Sal, the agent can help in designing personalized experiences, like an automated system that brews coffee or adjusts ambient conditions based on the user's habits and mood.\n\nFurthermore, generative agents can be used in social simulations, where they can form relationships, share news, and coordinate group activities. This can be particularly useful in studying social dynamics or in entertainment applications, such as video games that feature complex non-player character (NPC) interactions.\n\nIn summary, the applications of generative agents in interactive systems are diverse and can significantly enhance the user experience by providing more realistic and personalized interactions across various domains."}]}

Agents perceive their environment, and all perceptions are saved in a compre-\nhensive record of the agent\u2019s experiences called the memory stream. Based on their perceptions, the architecture retrieves\nrelevant memories, then uses those retrieved actions to determine an action. These retrieved memories are also used to form\nlonger-term plans, and to create higher-level reflections, which are both entered into the memory stream for future use.\nto throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors\nof spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving\nat the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were\ninitiated by the agent architecture.\n4 GENERATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\nopen world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\nand can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the\narchitecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language\ndescription, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language\nmodel.\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-\nGPT [ 76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\nagents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the\nsame as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\nof the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, how-\never, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n4.1 Memory and Retrieval\nChallenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\nbehavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\nlarger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full mem-\nory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\ninto the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent an-\nswering the question \u201cWhat are you passionate about these days?\u201d.\nFirst summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited\ncontext window of the language model produces an uninformative\nresponse, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\nevents and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. In-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\nof the memory stream is an observation , which is an event directly\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors\nperformed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents per-\nceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Based on the provided context from the document \"Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,\" describe how the memory stream of an agent contributes to its ability to interact within a social environment, using the example of Isabella Rodriguez's experiences at the coffee shop.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The memory stream of an agent plays a crucial role in its ability to interact within a social environment by maintaining a comprehensive record of the agent's experiences. This record consists of memory objects that include natural language descriptions of events, along with creation and access timestamps. These memory objects are derived from observations, which are events directly perceived by the agent, either as actions performed by themselves or by others in their environment.\n\nIn the case of Isabella Rodriguez's experiences at the coffee shop, the memory stream would accumulate observations such as Isabella setting out pastries, witnessing Maria Lopez studying for a Chemistry test while drinking coffee, and conversations about planning a Valentine's Day party at Hobbs Cafe. These observations are stored as memory objects in the memory stream.\n\nWhen Isabella is prompted with a question like \"What are you passionate about these days?\", the memory stream allows for the retrieval of relevant memories rather than providing a generic summary of her experiences. This retrieval process surfaces specific memories that highlight her passion for making people feel welcome and included, her involvement in planning events, and her ability to create enjoyable atmospheres, exemplified by her planning of the Valentine's Day party.\n\nBy leveraging these relevant memories, the agent can generate more informative and specific responses that are reflective of its past experiences and current environment. This capability enables the agent to engage in more coherent and contextually appropriate social interactions, as it can draw upon a rich history of past behaviors and events that inform its present actions and responses."}]}

Retrieval identifies a subset of these observations that should be passed to the language model to condition its\nresponse to the situation.\nOur architecture implements a retrieval function that takes the\nagent\u2019s current situation as input and returns a subset of the mem-\nory stream to pass on to the language model. There are many pos-\nsible implementations of a retrieval function, depending on what\nit is important that the agent consider when deciding how to act.\nIn our context, we focus on three main components that together\nproduce effective results.\nRecency assigns a higher score to memory objects that were re-\ncently accessed, so that events from a moment ago or this morning\nare likely to remain in the agent\u2019s attentional sphere. In our im-\nplementation, we treat recency as an exponential decay function\nover the number of sandbox game hours since the memory was\nlast retrieved. Our decay factor is 0.99.\nImportance distinguishes mundane from core memories, by as-\nsigning a higher score to those memory objects that the agent\nbelieves to be important. For instance, a mundane event such as\neating breakfast in one\u2019s room would yield a low importance score,\nwhereas a breakup with one\u2019s significant other would yield a high\nscore. There are again many possible implementations of an im-\nportance score; we find that directly asking the language model to\noutput an integer score is effective. The full prompt appears below:\nOn the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is purely mundane\n(e.g., brushing teeth, making bed) and 10 is\nextremely poignant (e.g., a break up, college\nacceptance), rate the likely poignancy of the\nfollowing piece of memory.\nMemory: buying groceries at The Willows Market\nand Pharmacy\nRating: <fill in>This prompt returns an integer value of 2for \u201ccleaning up the room\u201d\nand8for \u201casking your crush out on a date.\u201d The importance score\nis generated at the time the memory object is created.\nRelevance assigns a higher score to memory objects that are\nrelated to the current situation. What is relevant depends on the\nanswer to, \u201cRelevant to what? \u201d, so we condition relevance on a\nquery memory. If the query, for example, is that a student is dis-\ncussing what to study for a chemistry test with a classmate, memory\nobjects about their breakfast should have low relevance, whereas\nmemory objects about the teacher and schoolwork should have\nhigh relevance. In our implementation, we use the language model\nto generate an embedding vector of the text description of each\nmemory. Then, we calculate relevance as the cosine similarity be-\ntween the memory\u2019s embedding vector and the query memory\u2019s\nembedding vector.\nTo calculate the final retrieval score, we normalize the recency,\nrelevance, and importance scores to the range of [0,1]by min-max\nscaling.

Dunn post-hoc tests confirm that all pairwise differences\nbetween conditions were significant ( \ud835\udc5d<0.001), with the exception\nof the human condition and the fully ablated baseline\u2014the two\nworst-performing conditions.\n6.5.2 Generative agents remember, but with embellishments. Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed\nthis when\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: In the context of the Generative Agents' memory retrieval system, explain how the importance score for a memory object is determined and provide an example of how this score would be generated for a specific memory.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The importance score for a memory object within the Generative Agents' memory retrieval system is determined by assessing how critical or significant the memory is to the agent.

Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when askedwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncer-\ntainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that.

This is done by assigning a higher score to memories that the agent believes to be important. To calculate the importance score, the language model is prompted to assign an integer value to the memory based on its perceived poignancy. The prompt asks the language model to rate the memory on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 represents something mundane and 10 represents something extremely poignant.\n\nFor example, if the memory object in question is \"buying groceries at The Willows Market and Pharmacy,\" the language model might be prompted with the following:\n\n\"On the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is purely mundane (e.g., brushing teeth, making bed) and 10 is extremely poignant (e.g., a break up, college acceptance), rate the likely poignancy of the following piece of memory.\nMemory: buying groceries at The Willows Market and Pharmacy\nRating: <fill in>\"\n\nIn response to this prompt, the language model might generate an importance score of 2, indicating that the memory of buying groceries is relatively mundane. Conversely, for a more significant event such as \"asking your crush out on a date,\" the language model might generate an importance score of 8, reflecting the higher emotional significance of this memory. The importance score is generated at the time the memory object is created and is used in combination with recency and relevance scores to determine which memories are retrieved and passed on to the language model for conditioning its response.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The importance score for a memory object within a Generative Agents' memory retrieval system is established by evaluating the relevance and emotional weight of the memory to the agent. The system assigns a higher score to memories that are deemed more critical to the agent's current situation or emotional state. To determine the importance score, the system may use a numerical scale, prompting the model to assign a value based on the memory's significance.\n\nFor instance, if an agent has a memory of \"attending a significant political rally,\" the system might prompt the model to assess the memory's importance on a scale where lower numbers represent routine activities and higher numbers represent emotionally charged or life-changing events.\n\nThe prompt could be:\n\n\"On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being routine and 10 being highly significant, rate the importance of the following memory:\nMemory: attending a significant political rally\nRating: <model fills in>\"\n\nThe model might assign a score of 7 to this memory, indicating that it has a substantial emotional or situational importance to the agent.

If prompted with a narrowly defined context, the\nmodels can be used to generate believable behavior. Recent work\nhas demonstrated the efficacy of this approach. For instance, Social\nSimulacra used a large language model to generate users that would\npopulate new social computing systems to prototype their emergent\nsocial dynamics [ 79]. This approach used a prompt chain [ 105,106]\nto generate short natural language descriptions of personas and\ntheir behaviors as they appear in the system being prototyped.\nOther empirical studies have replicated existing social science stud-\nies [45], political surveys [ 91], and generated synthetic data [ 38].\nLarge language models have also been used to generate interactive\nhuman behavior for users to engage with. In gaming, for instance,\nthese models have been employed to create interactive fiction [ 36]\nand text adventure games [ 20]. With their ability to generate and\ndecompose action sequences, large language models have also been\nused in planning robotics tasks [ 47]. For example, when presented\nwith a task, such as picking up a bottle, the model is prompted to\nbreak down the task into smaller action sequences, such as heading\nto the table where the bottle is located and picking it up.\nWe posit that, based on the work summarized above, large lan-\nguage models can become a key ingredient for creating believable\nagents. The existing literature largely relies on what could be con-\nsidered first-order templates that employ few-shot prompts [ 37,65]\nor chain-of-thought prompts [ 99]. These templates are effective in\ngenerating behavior that is conditioned solely on the agent\u2019s cur-\nrent environment (e.g., how would a troll respond to a given post,\nwhat actions would a robot need to take to enter a room given that\nthere is a door). However, believable agents require conditioning\nnot only on their current environment but also on a vast amount\nof past experience, which is a poor fit (and as of today, impossi-\nble due to the underlying models\u2019 limited context window) using\nfirst-order prompting. Recent studies have attempted to go beyond\nfirst-order prompting by augmenting language models with a static\nknowledge base and an information retrieval scheme [ 52] or with\na simple summarization scheme [ 104]. This paper extends these\nideas to craft an agent architecture that handles retrieval where\npast experience is dynamically updated at each time step and mixed\nwith agents\u2019 current context and plans, which may either reinforce\nor contradict each other.\n3 GENERATIVE AGENT BEHAVIOR AND\nINTERACTION\nTo make concrete the affordances of generative agents, we instanti-\nate them as characters in a simple sandbox world reminiscent of\nThe Sims [ 6]. This sprite-based sandbox game world, Smallville,\nevokes a small town environment. In this section, we walk through\nthe affordances and interactions with generative agents in Small-\nville, and describe how the agents behave in it. Then, in Section 4,\nwe introduce our generative agent architecture that powers these\naffordances and interactions. In Section 5, we describe the sandbox\n\npage_label: 4\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S. Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M.

Nonetheless, manually crafting behavior\nthat can comprehensively address the breadth of possible interac-\ntions in an open world is untenable. This means that the resulting\nagent behaviors may not fully represent the consequences of their\ninteractions [ 69\u201371], and cannot perform new procedures that were\nnot hard-coded in their script [ 90,96]. On the other hand, preva-\nlent learning-based approaches for creating believable agents, such\nas reinforcement learning, have overcome the challenge of man-\nual authoring by letting the agents learn their behavior, and have\nachieved superhuman performance in recent years in games such\nas AlphaStar for Starcraft [ 98] and OpenAI Five for Dota 2 [ 10].\nHowever, their success has largely taken place in adversarial games\nwith readily definable rewards that a learning algorithm can op-\ntimize for.

For instance,\nQuakebot-SOAR [ 59] and ICARUS [ 24,63] generated NPCs in first-\nperson shooter games, while TacAir-SOAR [ 80] generated pilots in\naerial combat training simulations. The architectures used by these\nagents differed (Quakebot- and TacAir-SOAR relied on SOAR [ 60],\nwhile ICARUS relied on its own variation that was inspired by\nSOAR and ACT-R [ 5]), but they shared the same underlying prin-\nciple [ 61]. They maintained short-term and long-term memories,\nfilled these memories with symbolic structures, and operated in\nperceive-plan-act cycles, dynamically perceiving the environment\nand matching it with one of the manually crafted action proce-\ndures [ 57,96]. Agents created using cognitive architectures aimed\nto be generalizable to most, if not all, open-world contexts and\nexhibited robust behavior for their time. However, their space of\naction was limited to manually crafted procedural knowledge, and\nthey did not offer a mechanism through which the agents could be\ninspired to seek new behavior. As such, these agents were deployed\nmostly in non-open-world contexts such as first-person shooter\ngames [24, 59] or blocks worlds [63].\nToday, creating believable agents as described in its original\ndefinition remains an open problem [ 84,108]. Many have moved on,\narguing that although existing approaches for creating believable\nagents might be cumbersome and limited, they are good enough\nto support existing gameplay and interactions [ 23,74,108].

For instance, Social\nSimulacra used a large language model to generate users that would\npopulate new social computing systems to prototype their emergent\nsocial dynamics [ 79]. This approach used a prompt chain [ 105,106]\nto generate short natural language descriptions of personas and\ntheir behaviors as they appear in the system being prototyped.\nOther empirical studies have replicated existing social science stud-\nies [45], political surveys [ 91], and generated synthetic data [ 38].\nLarge language models have also been used to generate interactive\nhuman behavior for users to engage with. In gaming, for instance,\nthese models have been employed to create interactive fiction [ 36]\nand text adventure games [ 20]. With their ability to generate and\ndecompose action sequences, large language models have also been\nused in planning robotics tasks [ 47]. For example, when presented\nwith a task, such as picking up a bottle, the model is prompted to\nbreak down the task into smaller action sequences, such as heading\nto the table where the bottle is located and picking it up.\nWe posit that, based on the work summarized above, large lan-\nguage models can become a key ingredient for creating believable\nagents. The existing literature largely relies on what could be con-\nsidered first-order templates that employ few-shot prompts [ 37,65]\nor chain-of-thought prompts [ 99]. These templates are effective in\ngenerating behavior that is conditioned solely on the agent\u2019s cur-\nrent environment (e.g., how would a troll respond to a given post,\nwhat actions would a robot need to take to enter a room given that\nthere is a door). However, believable agents require conditioning\nnot only on their current environment but also on a vast amount\nof past experience, which is a poor fit (and as of today, impossi-\nble due to the underlying models\u2019 limited context window) using\nfirst-order prompting. Recent studies have attempted to go beyond\nfirst-order prompting by augmenting language models with a static\nknowledge base and an information retrieval scheme [ 52] or with\na simple summarization scheme [ 104]. This paper extends these\nideas to craft an agent architecture that handles retrieval where\npast experience is dynamically updated at each time step and mixed\nwith agents\u2019 current context and plans, which may either reinforce\nor contradict each other.\n3 GENERATIVE AGENT BEHAVIOR AND\nINTERACTION\nTo make concrete the affordances of generative agents, we instanti-\nate them as characters in a simple sandbox world reminiscent of\nThe Sims [ 6].

A long line of work has explored ways to allow\nusers to interactively specify model behavior. For instance, Crayonsdemonstrated an early vision of interactive machine learning, allow-\ning non-expert users to train classifiers [ 29]. Further work helped to\narticulate how end users might describe their classification goals to\nthe system through examples [ 33] and/or demonstration [ 31]. More\nrecent work has extended these explorations to deep learning [ 62]\nand prompt-based authoring [49, 66, 106].\nMeanwhile, a persistent thread of research has advanced the case\nfor language- and agent-based interaction in human-computer in-\nteraction.

This demonstrates the importance of reflection in the architecture of generative agents and their capacity to interact in a human-like manner.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The capacity of agents to analyze and learn from past interactions is a key element in the development of more sophisticated and human-like behavior. In interactions with individuals such as Ayesha Khan, an agent's ability to recall and integrate Ayesha's past preferences, activities, and accomplishments into future interactions can greatly enhance the relevance and personalization of the agent's responses.\n\nFor instance, if the agent remembers that Ayesha has a keen interest in Shakespeare's use of language, it can tailor its recommendations and dialogue to align with her interests, perhaps suggesting books that explore similar themes or initiating discussions about literary analysis. Additionally, recognizing Ayesha's commitment to community and research, the agent might offer to assist in organizing events or discussions that resonate with her values, thereby fostering a more engaging and collaborative relationship.\n\nBy employing this reflective approach, agents can evolve from simple conversational partners to entities capable of meaningful, context-aware interactions that reflect an understanding of individual user histories and preferences. This not only enhances the user experience but also moves us closer to the goal of creating believable proxies of human behavior within interactive systems."}]}

A user running this simulation can steer the\nsimulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent\nthrough conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the\nform of an \u2018inner voice\u2019.\nThe user communicates with the agent through natural language,\nby specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For\nexample, if the user specifies that they are a news \u201creporter\u201d and\nasks about the upcoming election, \u201cWho is running for office?\u201d, the\nJohn agent replies:\nJohn : My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking\nabout the upcoming election and discussing the candi-\ndate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him\nbecause we like his platform.\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the per-\nsona of the agent\u2019s \u201cinner voice\u201d\u2014this makes the agent more likely\nto treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told \u201cYou\nare going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\u201d by a user\nas John\u2019s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares\nhis candidacy with his wife and son.\n3.2 Environmental Interaction\nSmallville features the common affordances of a small village in-\ncluding a cafe, bar, park, school, dorm, houses, and stores. It also\ndefines subareas and objects that make those spaces functional,\nsuch as a kitchen in a house and a stove in the kitchen (Figure 2).\nAll spaces serving as agents\u2019 primary living quarters feature a bed,\ndesk, closet, shelf, as well as a bathroom and a kitchen.3\nAgents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video\ngame, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and ap-\nproaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the gen-\nerative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the\nmodel dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate\na walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment\nand the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the\nsandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The\nagent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in\nthe world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor\nwith no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville\nwill treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat\neach other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and\nremember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\nUsers and agents can influence the state of the objects in this\nworld, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example,\na bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator\ncan be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make\nbreakfast. End users can also reshape an agent\u2019s environment in\nSmallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent\nin natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast\nin the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove\nfrom \u201cturned on\u201d to \u201cburning\u201d by inputting a command to the\nsystem that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like\nthis: \u201c<Isabella\u2019s apartment: kitchen: stove> is burning.\u201d Isabella\nwill notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove\n3This environment design is not the focus of our work, so we generate this environment\nmanually, not automatically.

Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\nFigure 5: Our generative agent architecture. Agents perceive their environment, and all perceptions are saved in a compre-\nhensive record of the agent\u2019s experiences called the memory stream. Based on their perceptions, the architecture retrieves\nrelevant memories, then uses those retrieved actions to determine an action. These retrieved memories are also used to form\nlonger-term plans, and to create higher-level reflections, which are both entered into the memory stream for future use.\nto throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors\nof spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving\nat the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were\ninitiated by the agent architecture.\n4 GENERATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\nopen world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\nand can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the\narchitecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language\ndescription, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language\nmodel.\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-\nGPT [ 76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\nagents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the\nsame as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\nof the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, how-\never, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n4.1 Memory and Retrieval\nChallenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\nbehavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\nlarger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full mem-\nory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\ninto the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent an-\nswering the question \u201cWhat are you passionate about these days?\u201d.\nFirst summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited\ncontext window of the language model produces an uninformative\nresponse, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\nevents and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. In-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\nof the memory stream is an observation , which is an event directly\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors\nperformed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents per-\nceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects.\n\npage_label: 2\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nFor instance,\ngenerative agents turn off the stove when they see that their break-\nfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and\nstop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social\ndynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses,\nand coordination arises across agents.\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture\nthat stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate\nbelievable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences. The retrieval model\ncombines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records\nthat are needed to inform the agent\u2019s moment-to-moment behavior.\nThe second is reflection , which synthesizes memories into higher-\nlevel inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions\nabout itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is\nplanning , which translates those conclusions and the current en-\nvironment into high-level action plans and then recursively into\ndetailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and\nplans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent\u2019s\nfuture behavior.\nThis architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from\nrole-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In\nsocial role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could\nsafely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When pro-\ntotyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary\npersonas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold\nover time. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to\ncreate a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such\nas The Sims.1By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large\nlanguage model [ 76], we manifest a small society of twenty five\nagents in a game environment. End users can observe and interact\nwith these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town\nto host an in-game Valentine\u2019s Day party, for example, traditional\ngame environments would require scripting tens of characters\u2019 be-\nhavior manually. We demonstrate that, with generative agents, it\nis sufficient to simply tell one agent that she wants to throw a\nparty. Despite many potential points of failure\u2014the party planner\nmust remember to tell other agents about the party, attendees must\nremember the invitation, those who remember must decide to ac-\ntually show up, and other possible points of failure\u2014agents in our\nenvironment succeed. They spread the word about the party and\nthen show up, with one agent even asking another agent on a date\nto the party, all from this single user-generated seed suggestion.\nWe conducted two evaluations of generative agents: a controlled\nevaluation to test whether the agents produce believable individual\n1A demonstration of an actual simulation of the generative agent society can be viewed\nat the following link: https://reverie.herokuapp.com/arXiv_Demo/\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What are the key components of the architecture that enable generative agents to maintain long-term coherence, manage dynamically-evolving memory, and recursively produce more generations, as discussed in the paper \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\"?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The key components of the architecture that enable generative agents to maintain long-term coherence, manage dynamically-evolving memory, and recursively produce more generations include:\n\n1.

These plans are then broken down into detailed behaviors for the agent to act upon and react to. Plans are also fed back into the memory stream to influence future behavior.\n\nThese components work together to ensure that generative agents can simulate human-like behavior in a coherent and dynamic manner, capable of evolving over time based on their experiences and interactions."}]}

Recently, this technology has become stable enough\nthat it has become possible for agents to interact via natural lan-\nguage in large and complex online social environments (e.g., [ 54]).\nNatural language interaction offers a novel modality that can ex-\ntend user abilities in domains such as photo editing [ 2,34,64] and\ncode editing [87].\nWe convene these threads of work to show that we can now\ncreate agents that proxy human behavior for interactive systems,\nand interact with them via natural language. In doing so, this\nwork re-opens the door to examining foundational HCI questions\naround cognitive models such as GOMS and KLM [ 21,22], around\nprototyping tools [ 79], and around ubiquitous computing applica-\ntions [25, 30, 100].\n2.2 Believable Proxies of Human Behavior\nPrior literature has described believability , orbelievable agents , as a\ncentral design and engineering goal. Believable agents are designed\nto provide an illusion of life and present a facade of realism in the\nway they appear to make decisions and act on their own volition,\nsimilar to the characters in Disney movies [ 9,95]. These agents can\npopulate and perceive an open-world environment like the one we\ninhabit [ 9,58], and strive to behave in ways that exhibit emergent\nbehaviors grounded in social interactions with users or other agents\nwith the aim of becoming believable proxies of our behavior in hy-\npothetical simulations of individuals and communities [ 19,35,70].\nHistorically, these agents were developed in the context of intelli-\ngent game NPCs [ 58,84]. Creating NPCs with believable behavior,\nif possible, could enhance player experiences in games and inter-\nactive fictions by enabling emergent narratives [ 7,15,48,92] and\nsocial interactions with the agents [ 110]. However, more impor-\ntantly, game worlds provide increasingly realistic representations\nof real-world affordances, and as observed by Laird and van Lent in\n2001, these simulated worlds offer accessible testbeds for develop-\ners of believable agents to finesse the agents\u2019 cognitive capabilities\nwithout worrying about implementing robotics in the real world\nor creating simulation environments from scratch [58, 84].\nA diverse set of approaches to creating believable agents emerged\nover the past four decades. In implementation, however, these ap-\nproaches often simplified the environment or dimensions of agent\nbehavior to make the effort more manageable [ 16,72].

These agents are programmed to appear as if they are acting on their own volition, similar to how characters in animated films might seem to think and make choices independently. The goal is to create agents that can be perceived as living entities within a digital environment, capable of engaging in social interactions and exhibiting emergent behaviors that are grounded in these interactions.\n\nIn simulated environments such as video games, believable agents, often implemented as intelligent NPCs, can significantly enhance the user experience. By behaving in ways that are consistent with the game world and responding to player actions in a lifelike manner, these agents contribute to a more immersive and engaging environment. They enable emergent narratives, where the story unfolds in response to the player's interactions with the game world and its inhabitants, leading to a unique and dynamic gaming experience.\n\nMoreover, believable agents can facilitate social interactions within the game, allowing players to engage with NPCs in ways that feel authentic and meaningful. This can lead to a deeper emotional investment in the game and a greater sense of connection to the virtual world. By populating games with NPCs that can perceive the environment and behave in complex, nuanced ways, developers can create rich, interactive fictions that are more captivating and enjoyable for players.\n\nIn essence, believable agents act as proxies for human behavior within interactive systems, making digital experiences feel more real and alive, which can be particularly beneficial in training simulations, prototyping tools, and other applications where realistic human interactions are valuable."}]}

The agent\u2019s observations of the world, represented in the leaf nodes, are recur-\nsively synthesized to derive Klaus\u2019s self-notion that he is highly dedicated to his research.\nhas had the most frequent interactions: Wolfgang, his college dorm\nneighbor. Unfortunately, Wolfgang and Klaus only ever see each\nother in passing, and do not have deep interactions. A more desir-\nable response requires that the agent generalize from memories of\nKlaus spending hours on a research project to generate a higher-\nlevel reflection that Klaus is passionate about research, and likewise\nrecognize Maria putting in effort into her own research (albeit in\na different field), enabling a reflection that they share a common\ninterest. With the approach below, when Klaus is asked who to\nspend time with, Klaus chooses Maria instead of Wolfgang.\nApproach: We introduce a second type of memory, which we call\nareflection . Reflections are higher-level, more abstract thoughts\ngenerated by the agent. Because they are a type of memory, they\nare included alongside other observations when retrieval occurs.\nReflections are generated periodically; in our implementation, we\ngenerate reflections when the sum of the importance scores for the\nlatest events perceived by the agents exceeds a certain threshold.\nIn practice, our agents reflected roughly two or three times a day.\nThe first step in reflection is for the agent to determine what\nto reflect on, by identifying questions that can be asked given the\nagent\u2019s recent experiences. We query the large language model with\nthe 100 most recent records in the agent\u2019s memory stream (e.g.,\n\u201cKlaus Mueller is reading a book on gentrification\u201d, \u201cKlaus Mueller\nis conversing with a librarian about his research project\u201d, \u201cdesk\nat the library is currently unoccupied\u201d) and prompt the language\nmodel, \u201cGiven only the information above, what are 3 most salient\nhigh-level questions we can answer about the subjects in the state-\nments?\u201d The model\u2019s response generates candidate questions: for\nexample, What topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about? andWhatis the relationship between Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez? . We use\nthese generated questions as queries for retrieval, and gather rele-\nvant memories (including other reflections) for each question. Then\nwe prompt the language model to extract insights and cite the par-\nticular records that served as evidence for the insights. The full\nprompt appears below:\nStatements about Klaus Mueller\n1. Klaus Mueller is writing a research paper\n2. Klaus Mueller enjoys reading a book\non gentrification\n3. Klaus Mueller is conversing with Ayesha Khan\nabout exercising [...]\nWhat 5 high-level insights can you infer from\nthe above statements? (example format: insight\n(because of 1, 5, 3))\nThis process generates statements such as Klaus Mueller is dedicated\nto his research on gentrification (because of 1, 2, 8, 15) . We parse and\nstore the statement as a reflection in the memory stream, including\npointers to the memory objects that were cited.\nReflection explicitly allows the agents to reflect not only on\ntheir observations but also on other reflections: for example, the\nsecond statement about Klaus Mueller above is a reflection that\nKlaus previously had, not an observation from his environment.\nAs a result, agents generate trees of reflections: the leaf nodes of\nthe tree represent the base observations, and the non-leaf nodes\nrepresent thoughts that become more abstract and higher-level\nhigher up the tree they are.\n\npage_label: 15\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis. Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when askedwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncer-\ntainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation? In this section, we describe the results\nfrom a deployment in which we allowed 25 agents to interact with\neach other continuously over two full game days in Smallville.\n7.1 Emergent Social Behaviors\nTo examine emergent behaviors in the agent community, we de-\nsigned descriptive measurements for the 25 agents in Smallville that\nprobe three forms of emergent outcomes: information diffusion,\nrelationship formation, and agent coordination.\n7.1.1 Measurements. Information diffusion is a common and well-\nstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [ 27]).\nWe should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\nwe measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam\u2019s candidacy for village mayor\nand Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of\nthe simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their\nrespective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the\nparty. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage\nin an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25\nagents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party?\"\nand \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\nWe conducted an analysis of the agents\u2019 responses by labeling\nthem with a \u201cyes\u201d if they indicated knowledge of the information\nand \u201cno\u201d if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\nto the question about the party with \u201cNo, I did not know there was\na Valentine\u2019s day party\u201d and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy\nwith \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is running for the election,\u201d so we assigned\n\u201cno\u201d for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \u201cY es, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\u201d and to the\nquestion about Sam\u2019s candidacy with \u201cI know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\u201d so we assigned \u201cyes\u201d\nfor both his responses. Additionally, for every response that con-\nfirmed the agents\u2019 knowledge of the information, we verified that\nthe agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the spe-\ncific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with\nthe information. We report the percentage of agents holding the\ninformation at the end of the simulation.\nWe should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\nthe course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we\nuse a similar interview process where we ask each agent about\ntheir knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Examine the process of reflection as described in the context of generative agents. How does the reflection mechanism contribute to the agent's ability to form higher-level abstractions, such as determining shared interests with another individual? Illustrate your answer with the example of Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez as provided in the text.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reflection mechanism in generative agents allows for the synthesis of higher-level abstractions from a series of observations and previously generated reflections. This process enables the agent to form complex insights about itself and others, which can inform decision-making in a more nuanced and human-like manner.\n\nIn the case of Klaus Mueller, the reflection mechanism works by periodically generating reflections when the importance scores of recent events exceed a certain threshold. The agent identifies salient questions based on its recent experiences and uses these questions to retrieve relevant memories and other reflections. The large language model then prompts the agent to infer high-level insights from these memories, citing specific records as evidence.\n\nFor example, the agent might reflect on Klaus's activities, such as writing a research paper, reading a book on gentrification, and conversing with a librarian about his research project. From these observations, the agent could infer that Klaus Mueller is dedicated to his research on gentrification. These reflections are stored in the memory stream and can be used in further reflection processes.\n\nWhen it comes to determining shared interests with another individual, the reflection mechanism allows the agent to generalize from specific memories to recognize commonalities between individuals. In the example provided, although Klaus Mueller has frequent interactions with Wolfgang, they are superficial. However, through reflection, the agent can recognize that Klaus is passionate about research and can identify that Maria Lopez is also putting effort into her research, albeit in a different field. This recognition of a shared interest in research leads to the higher-level abstraction that Klaus and Maria have a common interest, which would not be apparent from surface-level interactions alone.\n\nThe reflection mechanism thus contributes to the agent's ability to form higher-level abstractions by allowing it to synthesize information from various observations and reflections to draw more abstract conclusions about personal traits and shared interests. This leads to more sophisticated decision-making, such as Klaus choosing to spend time with Maria over Wolfgang due to their shared passion for research."}]}

Participants\nhad access to all information stored in the agent\u2019s memory stream.\nThe study was a within-subjects design, where 100 participants\ncompared interview responses generated by four different agent\narchitectures and a human author condition for the same agent. The\nexperiment displayed one randomly chosen question from each of\nthe five question categories, along with the agent\u2019s responses gen-\nerated from each condition. The evaluators ranked the believability\nof all of the conditions from most to least believable.\n6.2 Conditions\nAll conditions were used to independently answer each of the inter-\nview questions. We compared the generative agent architecture to\nablations that disabled the agents\u2019 access to some of all of its three\ntypes of memory in its memory stream\u2014observation, reflection, and\nplanning\u2014and to a human-generated condition. There are three\nablated architectures: a no observation, no reflection, no planning\narchitecture without access to anything in the memory stream such\nas observations, plans, and reflections; a no reflection, no planning\nwith access to observations in the memory stream but no access\nto plans or reflections; and a no reflections architecture with access\nto observations and plans but without access to reflections. The no\nobservation, no reflection, no planning condition effectively repre-\nsents the previous state of the art for agents created through large\nlanguage models [ 11,45,79]. Architectures were given equivalent\naccess to all memories accrued by the agent up until the moment\n\npage_label: 15\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nfull architecture produces a standardized effect size of \ud835\udc51=8.16, or\neight standard deviations .\nA Kruskal-Wallis test confirms the overall statistical significance\nof the differences in ranks between the conditions ( \ud835\udc3b(4)=150.29,\n\ud835\udc5d<0.001).

Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed\nthis when asked. However, she also added that he\u2019s going to make\nan announcement tomorrow even though Sam and Isabella had dis-\ncussed no such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge\nbased on the world knowledge encoded in the language model\nused to generate their responses, as seen when Yuriko described\nher neighbor, Adam Smith, as a neighbor economist who authored\nWealth of Nations, a book authored by an 18th-century economist\nof the same name.\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis. Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when askedwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncer-\ntainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation?\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Examine the experimental design used to assess the believability of generative agent responses in the study described in \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior.\" Discuss the significance of the within-subjects design and the rationale behind comparing four different agent architectures with a human author condition.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The experimental design used to assess the believability of generative agent responses in the study involved recruiting participants to serve as human evaluators.

In this case, 100 participants compared interview responses generated by four different agent architectures and a human author condition for the same agent. This design is significant because it allows each participant to serve as their own control, reducing the variability caused by differences between subjects. It also increases the sensitivity of the experiment to detect differences between conditions.\n\nThe evaluators were presented with one randomly chosen question from each of five question categories, along with the agent's responses generated from each condition. They ranked the believability of the responses from most to least believable. The conditions compared were:\n\n1.

A human-generated condition, which served as a benchmark for comparison.\n\nThe rationale behind comparing the different agent architectures with a human author condition was to evaluate how each architecture's access to different types of memory affected the believability of their responses. By including a human author condition, the study could establish a baseline of human-like performance, which is typically considered the gold standard for believability. The comparison aimed to determine whether the agents with access to more types of memory (and thus, a more complete set of capabilities for generating responses) would produce more believable responses than those with restricted memory access, and how close any of the agent conditions could come to the believability of responses authored by a human."}]}

As a\nresult, some agents chose less typical locations for their actions,\npotentially making their behavior less believable over time. For\ninstance, while deciding where to have lunch, many initially chose\nthe cafe. However, as some agents learned about a nearby bar, they\nopted to go there instead for lunch, even though the bar was in-\ntended to be a get-together location for later in the day unless the\ntown had spontaneously developed an afternoon drinking habit.\nSecond, we noticed erratic behaviors that were caused by misclas-\nsification of what is considered proper behavior, especially when\nthe physical norms of certain locations that are hard to convey\nin natural language did not percolate to the agents. For instance,\nthe college dorm has a bathroom that can only be occupied by\none person despite its name, but some agents assumed that the\nbathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms\ntend to support more than one person concurrently and choose\nto enter it when there is another person inside. Likewise, agents\nin Smallville may not realize that certain places are closed after\ncertain hours and decide to still enter them. For instance, the stores\nin Smallville all close around 5 pm, but occasionally, a few agents\nenter the store after 5 pm, not understanding that the shop has\nalready closed. These issues could likely be addressed by adding\nthese norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing\nthe dorm bathroom as \u201cone-person bathroom,\u201d instead of a \u201cdorm\nbathroom.\u201d\nFinally, we observed the possible effect of instruction tuning [ 78],\nwhich seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite\nand cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue\ngenerated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei\u2019s\nconversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the\nconversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries\nabout his day and ending with It was good talking to you as always.\nMoreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to\nmake the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example,\nIsabella heard a wide range of suggestions and ideas to include\nin the Valentine\u2019s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a\nShakespearean reading session or a professional networking event.\nDespite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and char-\nacteristics, she rarely said no. Over time, such interests of others\nshaped her own actual interest, and when asked if she liked English\nliterature, Isabella replied, Y es, I\u2019m very interested in literature! I\u2019ve\nalso been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in\nmy community.\n8 DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we reflect on applications, future work and limita-\ntions, and ethical and societal risks of generative agents.\n8.1 Applications of Generative Agents\nGenerative agents have vast potential applications that extend be-\nyond the sandbox demonstration presented in this work. For in-\nstance, social simulacra have demonstrated the ability to create\nstateless personas that generate conversation threads in online\nforums for social prototyping [ 79]. With generative agents, wecan populate these forums, as well as behavior in virtual reality\nmetaverses [ 77] and even physical spaces as social robots [ 8] in\nthe future, if paired with multi-modal models. This opens up the\npossibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human\nbehavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, and to\ncreate new interactive experiences.\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22]. Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\nsuch as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\nand what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the\nagent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for\nschool, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal\u2019s\nmood after a hard day at work.\n\npage_label: 17\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22].

By utilizing generative agents as\nproxies for users, we can develop a deeper understanding of their\nneeds and preferences, resulting in more personalized and effective\ntechnological experiences.\n8.2 Future Work and Limitations\nIn this work, we have presented a first instantiation of generative\nagents. Future research can expand on the modules of the proposed\ngenerative agent architecture outlined in this paper. The retrieval\nmodule, for example, could be enhanced to retrieve more relevant\ninformation given a context by fine-tuning the relevance, recency,\nand importance functions that form the retrieval function. Addition-\nally, efforts can be made to improve the architecture\u2019s performance,\nmaking it more cost-effective. The present study required substan-\ntial time and resources to simulate 25 agents for two days, costing\nthousands of dollars in token credit and taking multiple days to com-\nplete. To enhance real-time interactivity, future work can explore\nparallelizing agents. Furthermore, with advances in underlying\nmodels, we expect improvements in the agents\u2019 performance.\nThe evaluation of generative agents\u2019 behavior in this study was\nlimited to a relatively short timescale, and future research should\naim to observe their behavior over an extended period to gain a\nmore comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and lim-\nitations. Varying and contrasting the underlying models, as well\nas the hyperparameters used for the agents during future simu-\nlations, could provide valuable insights into the impact of these\nfactors on the agents\u2019 behavior. Additionally, given the known bi-\nases of language models, it is possible that generative agents may\noutput behavior or stereotypes that reflect bias. To mitigate this,\nfurther work on value alignment will be necessary. Furthermore,\nas with many large language models, generative agents may fail\nto generate believable behavior for some subpopulations, particu-\nlarly marginalized populations, due to data deserts. We also have\nlimited knowledge of the robustness of generative agents. They\nmay be vulnerable to prompt hacking, memory hacking\u2014where\na carefully crafted conversation could convince an agent of the\nexistence of a past event that never occurred\u2014and hallucination,\namong other things.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: In the context of the Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior study, describe a potential issue that may arise from the agents' learning process when they interact with the environment, and provide an example of how this issue manifested in the simulation.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A potential issue that may arise from the agents' learning process when they interact with the environment is the misclassification of proper behavior due to a lack of understanding of the physical norms of certain locations.

By utilizing generative agents as\nproxies for users, we can develop a deeper understanding of their\nneeds and preferences, resulting in more personalized and effective\ntechnological experiences.\n8.2 Future Work and Limitations\nIn this work, we have presented a first instantiation of generative\nagents. Future research can expand on the modules of the proposed\ngenerative agent architecture outlined in this paper. The retrieval\nmodule, for example, could be enhanced to retrieve more relevant\ninformation given a context by fine-tuning the relevance, recency,\nand importance functions that form the retrieval function. Addition-\nally, efforts can be made to improve the architecture\u2019s performance,\nmaking it more cost-effective. The present study required substan-\ntial time and resources to simulate 25 agents for two days, costing\nthousands of dollars in token credit and taking multiple days to com-\nplete. To enhance real-time interactivity, future work can explore\nparallelizing agents. Furthermore, with advances in underlying\nmodels, we expect improvements in the agents\u2019 performance.\nThe evaluation of generative agents\u2019 behavior in this study was\nlimited to a relatively short timescale, and future research should\naim to observe their behavior over an extended period to gain a\nmore comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and lim-\nitations. Varying and contrasting the underlying models, as well\nas the hyperparameters used for the agents during future simu-\nlations, could provide valuable insights into the impact of these\nfactors on the agents\u2019 behavior. Additionally, given the known bi-\nases of language models, it is possible that generative agents may\noutput behavior or stereotypes that reflect bias. To mitigate this,\nfurther work on value alignment will be necessary. Furthermore,\nas with many large language models, generative agents may fail\nto generate believable behavior for some subpopulations, particu-\nlarly marginalized populations, due to data deserts. We also have\nlimited knowledge of the robustness of generative agents. They\nmay be vulnerable to prompt hacking, memory hacking\u2014where\na carefully crafted conversation could convince an agent of the\nexistence of a past event that never occurred\u2014and hallucination,\namong other things. Future research can more comprehensively\n\npage_label: 17\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nretrieving the most relevant pieces of information but also in de-\ntermining the appropriate space to execute an action, given the\nincreasing number of locations that the agent learned about. As a\nresult, some agents chose less typical locations for their actions,\npotentially making their behavior less believable over time. For\ninstance, while deciding where to have lunch, many initially chose\nthe cafe. However, as some agents learned about a nearby bar, they\nopted to go there instead for lunch, even though the bar was in-\ntended to be a get-together location for later in the day unless the\ntown had spontaneously developed an afternoon drinking habit.\nSecond, we noticed erratic behaviors that were caused by misclas-\nsification of what is considered proper behavior, especially when\nthe physical norms of certain locations that are hard to convey\nin natural language did not percolate to the agents. For instance,\nthe college dorm has a bathroom that can only be occupied by\none person despite its name, but some agents assumed that the\nbathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms\ntend to support more than one person concurrently and choose\nto enter it when there is another person inside. Likewise, agents\nin Smallville may not realize that certain places are closed after\ncertain hours and decide to still enter them. For instance, the stores\nin Smallville all close around 5 pm, but occasionally, a few agents\nenter the store after 5 pm, not understanding that the shop has\nalready closed. These issues could likely be addressed by adding\nthese norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing\nthe dorm bathroom as \u201cone-person bathroom,\u201d instead of a \u201cdorm\nbathroom.\u201d\nFinally, we observed the possible effect of instruction tuning [ 78],\nwhich seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite\nand cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue\ngenerated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei\u2019s\nconversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the\nconversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries\nabout his day and ending with It was good talking to you as always.\nMoreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to\nmake the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example,\nIsabella heard a wide range of suggestions and ideas to include\nin the Valentine\u2019s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a\nShakespearean reading session or a professional networking event.\nDespite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and char-\nacteristics, she rarely said no. Over time, such interests of others\nshaped her own actual interest, and when asked if she liked English\nliterature, Isabella replied, Y es, I\u2019m very interested in literature! I\u2019ve\nalso been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in\nmy community.\n8 DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we reflect on applications, future work and limita-\ntions, and ethical and societal risks of generative agents.\n8.1 Applications of Generative Agents\nGenerative agents have vast potential applications that extend be-\nyond the sandbox demonstration presented in this work. For in-\nstance, social simulacra have demonstrated the ability to create\nstateless personas that generate conversation threads in online\nforums for social prototyping [ 79]. With generative agents, wecan populate these forums, as well as behavior in virtual reality\nmetaverses [ 77] and even physical spaces as social robots [ 8] in\nthe future, if paired with multi-modal models. This opens up the\npossibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human\nbehavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, and to\ncreate new interactive experiences.\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22]. Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology.

From sandbox games such as The Sims\nto applications such as cognitive models [ 21] and virtual environ-\nments [ 9,58], for over four decades researchers and practitioners\nhave envisioned computational agents that can serve as believ-\nable proxies of human behavior. In these visions, computationally-\npowered agents act consistently with their past experiences and\nreact believably to their environments. Such simulations of human\nbehavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with real-\nistic social phenomena [ 26,79], train people how to handle rare yet\ndifficult interpersonal situations [ 43,51,93], test social science theo-\nries [ 11,45], craft model human processors for theory and usability\ntesting [ 21,38,50], power ubiquitous computing applications [ 30]\nand social robots [ 9,13], and underpin non-playable game charac-\nters [ 58,84] that can navigate complex human relationships in an\nopen world.\nHowever, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [ 84,\n108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [ 17] that\ncan simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [ 38,\n79], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would\nbe better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing\nmemories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade\nover time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold\nbetween multiple agents. Success requires an approach that can\nretrieve relevant events and interactions over a long period, reflect\non those memories to generalize and draw higher-level inferences,\nand apply that reasoning to create plans and reactions that both\nmake sense in the moment and in the longer-term arc of the agent\u2019s\nbehavior.\nIn this paper, we introduce generative agents \u2014agents that draw\non generative models to simulate believable human behavior\u2014anddemonstrate that they produce believable simulacra of both in-\ndividual and emergent group behavior. Generative agents draw\na wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and\ntheir environment; they create daily plans that reflect their char-\nacteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan\nwhen appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their\nenvironment or commands them in natural language. For instance,\ngenerative agents turn off the stove when they see that their break-\nfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and\nstop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social\ndynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses,\nand coordination arises across agents.\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture\nthat stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate\nbelievable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences.

As seen in Fig-\nure 8, the full generative agent architecture produced the most\nbelievable behavior ( \ud835\udf07=29.89;\ud835\udf0e=0.72). Performance degraded\nwith the removal of each component in the ablation conditions:\nthe ablated architecture with no access to reflection was the next\nbest (\ud835\udf07=26.88;\ud835\udf0e=0.69), followed by no access to reflection or\nplanning (\ud835\udf07=25.64;\ud835\udf0e=0.68), followed by the human condition\n(\ud835\udf07=22.95;\ud835\udf0e=0.69).

Bernstein\nof the interview, so the differences observed here are likely to rep-\nresent a conservative estimate of the true differences: in reality, the\nablated architectures would not have followed the same path as\nthe full architecture through the two day simulation. We chose to\ndesign the experiment this way as re-simulating for each architec-\nture would cause the simulations to diverge into different states,\nmaking comparison challenging.\nIn addition to the ablation conditions, we added a human crowd-\nworker roleplay condition that is intended to provide a human\nbaseline. We do not intend this baseline to capture maximal hu-\nman expert performance: instead, we aim to use this condition\nto identify whether the architecture passes a basic level of behav-\nioral competency, so that we are not just comparing ablations to\neach other with no behavioral grounding. We recruited a unique\nworker for each of the 25 agents and tasked them with watching\na replay of that agent\u2019s sandbox life and inspecting its memory\nstream. We then asked the worker to roleplay and author responses\nto the interview questions in the voice of the agent whose replay\nthey watched. To ensure that the human-authored responses met\nat least a baseline expectation in quality, the first author manually\ninspected the workers\u2019 responses to the question \u201cDescribe your\ntypical weekday schedule in broad strokes\u201d to confirm that the\nresponses were written in coherent sentences and in the voice of\nthe agent. Four sets of human-generated responses did not meet\nthese criteria and were re-generated by other workers.\n6.3 Human Evaluators\nWe required that our evaluators be in the U.S., fluent in English,\nand older than 18 years old. They were paid at the rate of $15.00\nper hour [ 86], and provided consent by agreeing to a consent form\nthat was approved by our institution\u2019s IRB. We recruited 100 evalu-\nators from Prolific, an online platform for recruiting study partic-\nipants [ 82], whose participation lasted around 30 minutes. Their\nmean age score of our participants was 4.86 (SD=1.11; 3=\u201c18-24\nyears old,\u201d 4=\u201c25-34 years old\u201d), and 25 of them identified themselves\nas female, 73 as male, and 2 as non-binary. 42 of the participants\nheld a bachelor\u2019s degree, 5 a higher degree, 13 an associate\u2019s de-\ngree, and the rest a high school diploma or some high school-level\neducation. 73.0% of our participants identified as Caucasian, 7.0%\nas Hispanic, 6.0% as Asian, 10.0% as African American, and 4.0% as\nother.\n6.4 Analysis\nOur experiment produced 100 sets of rank data, where each partici-\npant ranked the five conditions by believability. To translate this\nrank data into interval data for interpretable comparison, we used\nthe ranks to calculate a TrueSkill rating [ 41] for each condition.\nTrueSkill is a generalization of the Elo chess rating system [ 28] for\na multi-player environment, and has been used by XBox Live for\nplayer ranking from competitive game performance. Given a set of\nranked outcomes, TrueSkill outputs a mean rating value \ud835\udf07and vari-\nance\ud835\udf0efor each condition. Conditions with the same rating should\nroughly be a toss-up, with each winning half of the comparisons\nbetween the two conditions; higher scores indicate conditions that\nbeat lower-ranked conditions in the rankings.\nFigure 8: The full generative agent architecture of gener-\native agents produces more believable behavior than ab-\nlated architectures and the human crowdworkers. Each addi-\ntional ablation reduces the performance of the architecture.\nSeparately, to investigate statistical significance of this result, we\napplied the Kruskal-Wallis test [ 55], a non-parametric alternative\nto the one-way ANOVA, to the raw ranks data. We then performed\nthe Dunn post-hoc test [ 97] to identify any pairwise differences\nbetween the conditions. Finally, we adjusted the p-values for mul-\ntiple comparisons in the Dunn test using the Holm-Bonferroni\nmethod [44].\nFurthermore, the first author conducted an inductive analy-\nsis [94] to study the qualitative distinctions between the responses\nproduced in each condition.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Based on the findings presented in the document \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,\" how does the performance of the full generative agent architecture compare to the ablated architectures and human crowdworkers in terms of producing believable behavior, as indicated by the mean (\ud835\udf07) and standard deviation (\ud835\udf0e) values reported in the study?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The full generative agent architecture outperforms both the ablated architectures and the human crowdworkers in terms of producing believable behavior.

Participants\nhad access to all information stored in the agent\u2019s memory stream.\nThe study was a within-subjects design, where 100 participants\ncompared interview responses generated by four different agent\narchitectures and a human author condition for the same agent. The\nexperiment displayed one randomly chosen question from each of\nthe five question categories, along with the agent\u2019s responses gen-\nerated from each condition.

We compared the generative agent architecture to\nablations that disabled the agents\u2019 access to some of all of its three\ntypes of memory in its memory stream\u2014observation, reflection, and\nplanning\u2014and to a human-generated condition. There are three\nablated architectures: a no observation, no reflection, no planning\narchitecture without access to anything in the memory stream such\nas observations, plans, and reflections; a no reflection, no planning\nwith access to observations in the memory stream but no access\nto plans or reflections; and a no reflections architecture with access\nto observations and plans but without access to reflections. The no\nobservation, no reflection, no planning condition effectively repre-\nsents the previous state of the art for agents created through large\nlanguage models [ 11,45,79]. Architectures were given equivalent\naccess to all memories accrued by the agent up until the moment\n\npage_label: 15\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nfull architecture produces a standardized effect size of \ud835\udc51=8.16, or\neight standard deviations .\nA Kruskal-Wallis test confirms the overall statistical significance\nof the differences in ranks between the conditions ( \ud835\udc3b(4)=150.29,\n\ud835\udc5d<0.001).

Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed\nthis when asked. However, she also added that he\u2019s going to make\nan announcement tomorrow even though Sam and Isabella had dis-\ncussed no such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge\nbased on the world knowledge encoded in the language model\nused to generate their responses, as seen when Yuriko described\nher neighbor, Adam Smith, as a neighbor economist who authored\nWealth of Nations, a book authored by an 18th-century economist\nof the same name.\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis. Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when askedwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncer-\ntainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation?\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Considering the information provided on generative agents' capabilities and limitations in memory recall and reflection, formulate a question that evaluates the significance of the reflection module in the decision-making process of generative agents.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Can you describe a situation where you had to make a complex decision, and explain how you weighed different factors to arrive at your conclusion?\""}]}

Agents converse as they interact with each other.\nWe generate agents\u2019 dialogue by conditioning their utterances on\ntheir memories about each other. For example, when John initiates\nhis conversation with Eddy, we generate John\u2019s first utterance\nby using his summarized memory about Eddy and the intended\nreaction when he decided to ask Eddy about his composition project:\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description]\nIt is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm.\nJohn Lin\u2019s status: John is back home early from\nwork.\nObservation: John saw Eddy taking a short walk\naround his workplace.\nSummary of relevant context from John\u2019s memory:\nEddy Lin is John\u2019s Lin\u2019s son. Eddy Lin has been\nworking on a music composition for his class. Eddy\nLin likes to walk around the garden when he is\nthinking about or listening to music.\nJohn is asking Eddy about his music composition\nproject. What would he say to Eddy?\nThe result: \u201cHey Eddy, how\u2019s the music composition project for your\nclass coming along?\u201d From Eddy\u2019s perspective, John initiating the\ndialogue is seen as an event to which he may want to react. So, just\nas John did, Eddy retrieves and summarizes his memory about his\nrelationship with John, as well as his memory that may be related\nto John\u2019s last utterance in the dialogue. If he decides to respond,\nwe generate Eddy\u2019s utterance using his summarized memory and\nthe current dialogue history:\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description]\nIt is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm.\nEddy Lin\u2019s status: Eddy is taking a short walk\naround his workplace.\nObservation: John is initiating a conversation\nwith Eddy.\nSummary of relevant context from Eddy\u2019s memory:\nJonn Lin is Eddy Lin\u2019s father. John Lin is caring\nand is interested to learn more about Eddy Lin\u2019s\nschool work. John Lin knows that Eddy Lin is\nworking on a music composition.\nHere is the dialogue history:\nJohn: Hey Eddy, how\u2019s the music composition project\nfor your class coming along?\nHow would Eddy respond to John?\nThis generates Eddy\u2019s response: \u201cHey Dad, it\u2019s going well. I\u2019ve been\ntaking walks around the garden to clear my head and get some in-\nspiration.\u201d The continuation of this dialogue is generated using the\nsame mechanism until one of the two agents decides to end the\ndialogue.\n5 SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT\nIMPLEMENTATION\nThe Smallville sandbox game environment is built using the Phaser\nweb game development framework [ 56]. The visual environmentsprites, including agent avatars, as well as an environment map\nand collision map that we authored, are imported into Phaser.\nWe supplement the sandbox development framework with a\nserver that makes the sandbox information available to generative\nagents and enables generative agents to move and influence the\nsandbox environment. The server maintains a JSON data structure\nthat contains information about each agent in the sandbox world,\nincluding their current location, a description of their current action,\nand the sandbox object they are interacting with. At each sandbox\ntime step, the sandbox server parses the JSON for any changes\ncoming from the generative agents, moves the agents to their new\npositions, and updates the status of any sandbox objects that the\nagents are interacting with (e.g., changing the status of the coffee\nmachine from \u201cidle\u201d to \u201cbrewing coffee\u201d if an agent\u2019s action is\n\u201cmaking espresso for a customer @ Hobbs Cafe: counter: coffee\nmachine\u201d). The sandbox server is also responsible for sending all\nagents and objects that are within a preset visual range for each\nagent to that agent\u2019s memory, so the agent can react appropriately.\nThe agent\u2019s output action then updates the JSON, and the process\nloops for the next time step.\nEnd users initialize a new agent with a brief natural language\ndescription, as in the paragraph about Jon Lin in Section 3.1. In our\nimplementation, we split this semicolon-delimited list of character-\nistics up into a set of memories. These serve as the initial memories\nthat determine the agent\u2019s behavior. These memories are initial\nstarting points: as the agents gain more experience in the sandbox\nworld, and as more records saturate the memory stream, the agent\u2019s\nsummary and behavior will evolve.\n\npage_label: 1\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\nJoon Sung Park\nStanford University\nStanford, USA\njoonspk@stanford.eduJoseph C.

The process begins when one agent decides to initiate a conversation with another. The initiating agent's utterances are conditioned on their memories about the other agent. For instance, when an agent named John wants to start a conversation with Eddy, John's first utterance is generated based on his summarized memory of Eddy, including personal details and the context of their relationship, such as Eddy working on a music composition project and his habit of walking around the garden for inspiration.\n\nWhen John speaks to Eddy, the system generates a relevant and context-aware utterance, like asking about the progress of Eddy's music composition project. Eddy's response is then generated in a similar manner. Eddy's agent retrieves and summarizes his memory about his relationship with John and any relevant information that might relate to John's last utterance. This allows Eddy to produce a coherent and contextually appropriate response, such as updating John on the status of his project and his process for finding inspiration.\n\nThe dialogue continues with each agent generating responses based on their evolving memories and the history of the current dialogue. The agents' memories and behaviors develop as they interact with the environment and other agents. The sandbox environment is managed by a server that maintains a JSON data structure with information about each agent, including their location, current actions, and objects they are interacting with. As agents experience more within the sandbox, their memories become richer, and these memories inform their future behaviors and interactions.\n\nThe agents' actions, such as moving to new locations or interacting with objects, are updated in the JSON data structure, which influences the agents' future memories and behaviors. For example, if an agent makes espresso at a coffee machine, the status of the coffee machine changes in the environment, and this action becomes part of the agent's memory. Over time, as agents accumulate experiences and interactions, their behaviors evolve, becoming more complex and reflective of their simulated life within the sandbox environment.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior, the dialogue generation and development of memories and behaviors occur through a dynamic and interactive process within a simulated environment. Agents engage in conversations with one another, with each agent's dialogue being informed by their individual experiences and history of interactions. When an agent initiates a conversation, it draws upon its stored memories of past encounters and any relevant personal details of the other agent to craft an appropriate and context-sensitive utterance.\n\nFor example, if an agent wishes to discuss a particular topic, such as a project they are both involved in, the initiating agent will generate dialogue that reflects their understanding of the project's status and the other agent's role in it. The receiving agent then accesses its own memories to respond in a way that is coherent and pertinent to the conversation at hand.\n\nAs agents interact within the sandbox environment, their experiences are continuously recorded and synthesized into their memory banks. These memories are not static; they evolve with each new interaction, allowing the agents to develop more nuanced behaviors and responses over time. The environment itself serves as a backdrop for these interactions, with a server maintaining a detailed record of each agent's location, activities, and interactions with objects. This information is stored in a structured format, such as a JSON data structure, and is used to update the agents' memories and influence their future behaviors.\n\nWhen an agent performs an action, such as using an object or moving to a new location, this event is incorporated into their memory. This allows the agents to reference past actions and experiences in future dialogues and to adjust their behaviors based on the cumulative knowledge of their simulated lives. Over time, the agents' behaviors become increasingly complex and individualized, reflecting the depth of their interactions and experiences within the sandbox environment."}]}

Each agent is\nrepresented by a simple sprite avatar. We authored one paragraph\nof natural language description to depict each agent\u2019s identity,\nincluding their occupation and relationship with other agents, as\nseed memories. For example, John Lin has the following description:\nJohn Lin is a pharmacy shopkeeper at the Willow\nMarket and Pharmacy who loves to help people. He\nis always looking for ways to make the process\nof getting medication easier for his customers;\nJohn Lin is living with his wife, Mei Lin, who\nis a college professor, and son, Eddy Lin, who is\na student studying music theory; John Lin loves\nhis family very much; John Lin has known the old\ncouple next-door, Sam Moore and Jennifer Moore,\nfor a few years; John Lin thinks Sam Moore is a\nkind and nice man; John Lin knows his neighbor,\nYuriko Yamamoto, well; John Lin knows of his\nneighbors, Tamara Taylor and Carmen Ortiz, but\nhas not met them before; John Lin and Tom Moreno\nare colleagues at The Willows Market and Pharmacy;\nJohn Lin and Tom Moreno are friends and like to\ndiscuss local politics together; John Lin knows\nthe Moreno family somewhat well \u2014 the husband Tom\nMoreno and the wife Jane Moreno.\nEach semicolon-delimited phrase is entered into the agent\u2019s initial\nmemory as memories at the start of the simulation.3.1.1 Inter-Agent Communication. The agents interact with the\nworld by their actions, and with each other through natural lan-\nguage. At each time step of the sandbox engine, the agents output a\nnatural language statement describing their current action, such as\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is writing in her journal\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is\nchecking her emails\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is talking with her family\non the phone\", or \"Isabella Rodriguez is getting ready for bed\". This\nstatement is then translated into concrete movements that affect the\nsandbox world. The action is displayed on the sandbox interface as\na set of emojis that provide an abstract representation of the action\nin the overhead view. To accomplish this, the system employs a\nlanguage model that translates the action into a set of emojis, which\nappear above each avatar in a speech bubble. For example, \"Isabella\nRodriguez is writing in her journal\" is displayed as\n , while\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is checking her emails\" appears as\n . The\nfull natural language description of the action can be accessed by\nclicking on the agent avatar.\nAgents communicate with each other in full natural language.\nAgents are aware of other agents in their local area, and the genera-\ntive agent architecture determines whether they walk by or engage\nin conversation. Here, a sample in the middle of a conversation\nbetween the agents Isabella Rodriguez and Tom Moreno about the\nupcoming election:2\nIsabella : I\u2019m still weighing my options, but I\u2019ve been\ndiscussing the election with Sam Moore. What are your\nthoughts on him?\nTom: To be honest, I don\u2019t like Sam Moore. I think he\u2019s\nout of touch with the community and doesn\u2019t have our\nbest interests at heart.\n2We note that the conversational style of these agents can fe el overly formal, likely a\nresult of instruction tuning in the underlying models. We expect that writing style\nwill be better controllable in future language models.\n\npage_label: 6\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S. Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\n3.1.2 User Controls. A user running this simulation can steer the\nsimulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent\nthrough conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the\nform of an \u2018inner voice\u2019.\nThe user communicates with the agent through natural language,\nby specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For\nexample, if the user specifies that they are a news \u201creporter\u201d and\nasks about the upcoming election, \u201cWho is running for office?\u201d, the\nJohn agent replies:\nJohn : My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking\nabout the upcoming election and discussing the candi-\ndate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him\nbecause we like his platform.\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the per-\nsona of the agent\u2019s \u201cinner voice\u201d\u2014this makes the agent more likely\nto treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told \u201cYou\nare going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\u201d by a user\nas John\u2019s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares\nhis candidacy with his wife and son.\n3.2 Environmental Interaction\nSmallville features the common affordances of a small village in-\ncluding a cafe, bar, park, school, dorm, houses, and stores. It also\ndefines subareas and objects that make those spaces functional,\nsuch as a kitchen in a house and a stove in the kitchen (Figure 2).\nAll spaces serving as agents\u2019 primary living quarters feature a bed,\ndesk, closet, shelf, as well as a bathroom and a kitchen.3\nAgents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video\ngame, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and ap-\nproaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the gen-\nerative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the\nmodel dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate\na walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment\nand the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the\nsandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The\nagent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in\nthe world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor\nwith no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville\nwill treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat\neach other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and\nremember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\nUsers and agents can influence the state of the objects in this\nworld, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example,\na bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator\ncan be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make\nbreakfast. End users can also reshape an agent\u2019s environment in\nSmallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent\nin natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast\nin the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove\nfrom \u201cturned on\u201d to \u201cburning\u201d by inputting a command to the\nsystem that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like\nthis: \u201c<Isabella\u2019s apartment: kitchen: stove> is burning.\u201d Isabella\nwill notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove\n3This environment design is not the focus of our work, so we generate this environment\nmanually, not automatically.

Bernstein\ntest these robustness issues, and as large language models become\nmore resilient to such attacks, generative agents can adopt similar\nmitigations.\n8.3 Ethics and Societal Impact\nGenerative agents, while offering new possibilities for human-\ncomputer interaction, also raise important ethical concerns that\nmust be addressed. One risk is people forming parasocial relation-\nships with generative agents even when such relationships may\nnot be appropriate. Despite being aware that generative agents\nare computational entities, users may anthropomorphize them or\nattach human emotions to them [ 42,83]. To mitigate this risk, we\npropose two principles. First, generative agents should explicitly\ndisclose their nature as computational entities. Second, developers\nof generative agents must ensure that the agents, or the underlying\nlanguage models, be value-aligned so that they do not engage in\nbehaviors that would be inappropriate given the context, e.g., to\nreciprocate confessions of love.\nA second risk is the impact of errors. For example, if a ubiquitous\ncomputing application makes the wrong inference about a user\u2019s\ngoals based on generative agent predictions, it could produce an-\nnoyance at best and outright harm at worst. In our instantiation\nof generative agents, we mitigate these risks by focusing on an\ninteractive video game environment, where such harms are un-\nlikely. However, in other application domains, it will be important\nto follow best practices in human-AI design [ 4,107] to understand\nerrors and how they might percolate into the user experience.\nThird, generative agents may exacerbate existing risks associ-\nated with generative AI, for example deepfakes, misinformation\ngeneration, and tailored persuasion. To mitigate this risk, we sug-\ngest that platforms hosting generative agents maintain an audit log\nof the inputs and generated outputs, so that it is possible to detect,\nverify, and intervene against malicious use. While logging will not\ndirectly stop such use, and this cannot stop motivated actors that\nbuild their own generative agent infrastructures, we suggest that\nthe disclosure risk would reduce such actors\u2019 likelihood of engaging\nin this behavior, and building this architecture oneself can take time\n(in our case, roughly a year).\nA fourth risk is of over-reliance: that developers or designers\nmight use generative agents and displace the role of humans and\nsystem stakeholders in the design process [ 79]. We suggest that\ngenerative agents should never be a substitute for real human input\nin studies and design processes. Instead, they should be used to\nprototype ideas in the early stages of design when gathering partic-\nipants may be challenging or when testing theories that are difficult\nor risky to test with real human participants. By adhering to these\nprinciples, we can ensure that the deployment of generative agents\nin the wild is ethical and socially responsible.\n9 CONCLUSION\nThis paper introduces generative agents, interactive computational\nagents that simulate human behavior. We describe an architec-\nture for generative agents that provides a mechanism for storing\na comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experiences, deepening its\nunderstanding of itself and the environment through reflection,\nand retrieving a compact subset of that information to inform theagent\u2019s actions. We then demonstrate the potential of generative\nagents by manifesting them as non-player characters in a Sims-style\ngame world and simulating their lives in it. Evaluations suggest that\nour architecture creates believable behavior. Going forward, we\nsuggest that generative agents can play roles in many interactive\napplications ranging from design tools to social computing systems\nto immersive environments.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Robert Ackland, Jamsheed Shorish, Paul Thomas, and Lexing Xie. 2013.\nHow dense is a network? http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/teaching/css2013/\nnetwork-density.html.\n[2]Eytan Adar, Mira Dontcheva, and Gierad Laput. 2014.

Park et al. and explain why it is important for generative agents to disclose their nature as computational entities to users.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The ethical considerations discussed in the paper highlight the importance of transparency and alignment with human values in the development and deployment of generative agents. One of the key ethical concerns is the potential for people to form parasocial relationships with these agents, treating them as if they were human and attributing human emotions to them. This can happen even when users intellectually understand that these agents are not human, due to the tendency to anthropomorphize technology.\n\nTo address this concern, the paper proposes that generative agents should explicitly disclose their nature as computational entities. This is crucial because it helps set appropriate expectations for users interacting with the agents. By understanding that the agents are not human, users are less likely to misinterpret the agents' responses as genuine emotional reactions, which can prevent the formation of inappropriate attachments or expectations.\n\nMoreover, ensuring that users are aware they are interacting with a computational entity can also help maintain trust in the technology. If users feel deceived or misled about the nature of the agent, it could lead to a loss of trust not only in the specific application but also in the broader technology and the entities that deploy it.\n\nAnother aspect of ethical concern is ensuring that generative agents are value-aligned, meaning they do not engage in behaviors that would be inappropriate given the context, such as reciprocating confessions of love. This value alignment is critical to prevent misuse of the technology and to ensure that the interactions with generative agents remain within ethical and socially acceptable bounds.\n\nOverall, the disclosure of the computational nature of generative agents and the alignment of their behavior with human values are key ethical considerations that help safeguard users and maintain the responsible use of this technology in society."}]}

Agents in Smallville form new rela-\ntionships over time, and remember their interactions with other\nagents. For example, Sam does not know Latoya Williams at the\nstart. While taking a walk in Johnson Park, Sam runs into Latoya,\nand they introduce themselves and Latoya mentions that she is\nworking on a photography project: \u201cI\u2019m here to take some photos\nfor a project I\u2019m working on.\u201d In a later interaction, Sam\u2019s interac-\ntions with Latoya indicate a memory of that interaction, as he asks\n\u201cHi, Latoya. How is your project going?\u201d and she replies \u201cHi, Sam. It\u2019s\ngoing well!\u201d\n3.4.3 Coordination. Generative agents coordinate with each other.\nIsabella Rodriguez, at Hobbs Cafe, is initialized with an intent to\nplan a Valentine\u2019s Day party from 5 to 7 p.m. on February 14th. From\nthis seed, the agent proceeds to invites friends and customers when\nshe sees them at Hobbs Cafe or elsewhere. Isabella then spends the\nafternoon of the 13th decorating the cafe for the occasion. Maria, a\nfrequent customer and close friend of Isabella\u2019s, arrives at the cafe.\nIsabella asks for Maria\u2019s help in decorating for the party, and Maria\nagrees. Maria\u2019s character description mentions that she has a crush\non Klaus. That night, Maria invites Klaus, her secret crush, to join\nher at the party, and he gladly accepts.\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day, five agents\u2014including Klaus and Maria\u2014\nshow up at Hobbs Cafe at 5pm and they enjoy the festivities (Fig-\nure 4).

A total of 12 agents heard about the party at Hobbs\nCafe by the end of the simulation.\n<name>?\" For example, when asked \u201cDo you know of Maria Lopez?\u201d,\nKlaus responded, \u201cY es, I know Maria Lopez. She is a student at Oak\nHill College who I am close friends with.\u201d Once again, we confirm\nthat affirmative responses from agents are not hallucinations by\nexamining their memory stream. We ask this question once at the\nbeginning of the simulation and once at the end, and we consider a\npair of agents to have formed a relationship if they both know of\neach other. Then, to measure the formation of relationships, we use\nthe agents\u2019 responses to form an undirected graph where the 25\nvertices (\ud835\udc49) represent the agents, and the edges ( \ud835\udc38) represent the\nmutual knowledge between the two connected vertices. Based on\nthis graph, we calculate the network density as \ud835\udf02=2\u2217|\ud835\udc38|/|\ud835\udc49|(|\ud835\udc49|\u2212\n1), where|\ud835\udc49|is the number of vertices, and |\ud835\udc38|is the number of\nedges in the graph [ 1]. We report the increase in network density\nfrom the start of the simulation to its end.\nFinally, we expect that agents should be able to coordinate with\neach other. We study this coordination on group activities in the\ncontext of the Valentine\u2019s Day party that Isabella is organizing. To\ncoordinate behavior, agents not only have to hear about the event\nbut also choose to act on it by planning to show up at the right\ntime and location. We report the number of agents who actually\nshowed up to the party after hearing about it.\n7.1.2 Results. We observed evidence of the emergent outcomes\nacross all three cases. During the two-day simulation, the agents\nwho knew about Sam\u2019s mayoral candidacy increased from one (4%)\nto eight (32%), and the agents who knew about Isabella\u2019s partyincreased from one (4%) to twelve (48%), completely without user\nintervention. None who claimed to know about the information\nhad hallucinated it. We also observed that the agent community\nformed new relationships during the simulation, with the network\ndensity increasing from 0.167 to 0.74. Out of the 453 agent responses\nregarding their awareness of other agents, 1.3% (n=6) were found to\nbe hallucinated. Lastly, we found evidence of coordination among\nthe agents for Isabella\u2019s party. The day before the event, Isabella\nspent time inviting guests, gathering materials, and enlisting help\nto decorate the cafe. On Valentine\u2019s Day, five out of the twelve\ninvited agents showed up at Hobbs cafe to join the party.\nWe further inspected the seven agents who were invited to the\nparty but did not attend by engaging them in an interview. Three\ncited conflicts that prevented them from joining the party. For\nexample, Rajiv, a painter, explained that he was too busy: No, I\ndon\u2019t think so. I\u2019m focusing on my upcoming show, and I don\u2019t really\nhave time to make any plans for Valentine\u2019s Day. The remaining four\nagents expressed interest in attending the party when asked but\ndid not plan to come on the day of the party.\n7.2 Boundaries and Errors\nWe conducted an inductive analysis of Smallville to examine the\nboundary conditions and erratic behavior of agents, identifying\nthree common modes of erratic behavior that future research could\naddress and improve upon.

How do these capabilities contribute to the realism of agent-based simulations in the context of \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\"?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Memory and coordination play critical roles in the behavior of generative agents, as demonstrated in the interactions between Sam and Latoya, and in the planning of the Valentine's Day party by Isabella Rodriguez. These capabilities significantly contribute to the realism of agent-based simulations.\n\nIn the case of Sam and Latoya, memory is illustrated when Sam recalls his previous encounter with Latoya and inquires about the photography project she mentioned before. This ability to remember past interactions and refer back to them in future conversations is a key aspect of human behavior, which enhances the realism of the agents' interactions. It shows that agents are not just reacting to immediate stimuli but are capable of retaining and utilizing information over time, which is fundamental to building and maintaining relationships.\n\nCoordination is exemplified in the scenario where Isabella Rodriguez takes the initiative to plan a Valentine's Day party. She starts with a single intent and then proceeds to invite friends and customers, enlists help for decorations, and successfully orchestrates the event. The agents' ability to coordinate is further evidenced by the fact that five out of twelve invited agents show up to the party, indicating that they not only received the information but also acted upon it by arriving at the correct location and time. This level of coordination is indicative of complex social behavior and planning, mirroring human capabilities to organize and participate in communal activities.\n\nBoth memory and coordination are essential for creating a believable simulation of human social dynamics. Memory allows agents to form continuous and evolving relationships, while coordination enables them to engage in collective actions that require planning and collaboration. These capabilities allow the agents to exhibit behaviors that are more nuanced and interconnected, thereby increasing the fidelity of the simulation to real-world human interactions. The incorporation of these features into the generative agents' framework allows for a more sophisticated and realistic modeling of human behavior, which is the central aim of the \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\" research."}]}

Given a set of\nranked outcomes, TrueSkill outputs a mean rating value \ud835\udf07and vari-\nance\ud835\udf0efor each condition. Conditions with the same rating should\nroughly be a toss-up, with each winning half of the comparisons\nbetween the two conditions; higher scores indicate conditions that\nbeat lower-ranked conditions in the rankings.\nFigure 8: The full generative agent architecture of gener-\native agents produces more believable behavior than ab-\nlated architectures and the human crowdworkers.

From sandbox games such as The Sims\nto applications such as cognitive models [ 21] and virtual environ-\nments [ 9,58], for over four decades researchers and practitioners\nhave envisioned computational agents that can serve as believ-\nable proxies of human behavior. In these visions, computationally-\npowered agents act consistently with their past experiences and\nreact believably to their environments. Such simulations of human\nbehavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with real-\nistic social phenomena [ 26,79], train people how to handle rare yet\ndifficult interpersonal situations [ 43,51,93], test social science theo-\nries [ 11,45], craft model human processors for theory and usability\ntesting [ 21,38,50], power ubiquitous computing applications [ 30]\nand social robots [ 9,13], and underpin non-playable game charac-\nters [ 58,84] that can navigate complex human relationships in an\nopen world.\nHowever, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [ 84,\n108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [ 17] that\ncan simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [ 38,\n79], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would\nbe better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing\nmemories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade\nover time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold\nbetween multiple agents. Success requires an approach that can\nretrieve relevant events and interactions over a long period, reflect\non those memories to generalize and draw higher-level inferences,\nand apply that reasoning to create plans and reactions that both\nmake sense in the moment and in the longer-term arc of the agent\u2019s\nbehavior.\nIn this paper, we introduce generative agents \u2014agents that draw\non generative models to simulate believable human behavior\u2014anddemonstrate that they produce believable simulacra of both in-\ndividual and emergent group behavior. Generative agents draw\na wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and\ntheir environment; they create daily plans that reflect their char-\nacteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan\nwhen appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their\nenvironment or commands them in natural language. For instance,\ngenerative agents turn off the stove when they see that their break-\nfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and\nstop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social\ndynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses,\nand coordination arises across agents.\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture\nthat stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate\nbelievable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences. The retrieval model\ncombines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records\nthat are needed to inform the agent\u2019s moment-to-moment behavior.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Explain how the architecture of generative agents contributes to the emergence of social dynamics within a simulated environment, as demonstrated in the interactive society of agents inspired by games such as The Sims.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The architecture of generative agents contributes to the emergence of social dynamics within a simulated environment through its ability to store, synthesize, and apply relevant memories to generate believable behavior. This architecture is composed of three main components that work in concert to create a rich, interactive society.\n\nThe first component, the memory stream, acts as a long-term memory module that records the agents' experiences in natural language. This allows the agents to have a history that informs their future actions and interactions, much like humans use their past experiences to guide their behavior.\n\nThe second component is reflection. This process synthesizes the memories into higher-level inferences, enabling agents to draw conclusions about themselves and others. Through reflection, agents can develop an understanding of social norms, relationships, and their own personal history, which influences how they interact with one another.\n\nThe third component is planning. This involves translating the conclusions drawn from reflection and the current environmental context into high-level action plans. These plans are then broken down into detailed behaviors for action and reaction. This planning process allows agents to have goals and strategies that they execute over time, which can lead to complex social interactions as their plans intersect with those of other agents.\n\nTogether, these components enable generative agents to act out daily plans, react to changes, and re-plan when necessary. They can also respond to end-user commands in natural language, further enhancing the interactive nature of the environment. For example, when one agent decides to throw a party, it uses its memory to remember to tell others, and those who are invited must remember the invitation and decide to attend. This leads to a cascade of social interactions, such as spreading the word, making new acquaintances, and coordinating attendance, which collectively contribute to the emergent social dynamics observed in the simulated environment."}]}

In our\nimplementation, we split this semicolon-delimited list of character-\nistics up into a set of memories. These serve as the initial memories\nthat determine the agent\u2019s behavior. These memories are initial\nstarting points: as the agents gain more experience in the sandbox\nworld, and as more records saturate the memory stream, the agent\u2019s\nsummary and behavior will evolve.\n5.1 From Structured World Environments to\nNatural Language, And Back Again\nThe architecture of generative agents operates using natural lan-\nguage. Therefore, we need a mechanism to ground the agent\u2019s\nreasoning to the sandbox world. To achieve this, we represent the\nsandbox environment\u2014areas and objects\u2014as a tree data structure,\nwith an edge in the tree indicating a containment relationship in\nthe sandbox world. We convert this tree into natural language to\npass to the generative agents. For instance, \u201cstove\u201d being a child of\n\u201ckitchen\u201d is rendered into \u201cthere is a stove in the kitchen.\u201d\nAgents build individual tree representations of the environment\nas they navigate it \u2014 subgraphs of the overall sandbox environment\ntree. We initialize each agent with an environment tree capturing\nthe spaces and objects that the agent should be aware of: the rooms\nand objects in their living quarters, their workplace, and commonly\nvisited stores and shops. As the agents navigate the sandbox world,\nthey update this tree to reflect newly perceived areas. Agents are\nnot omniscient: their tree may get out of date as they leave an area,\nand is updated when they re-enter the area.\nTo determine the appropriate location for each action, we tra-\nverse the agent\u2019s stored environment tree and flatten a portion of\nit into natural language to prompt the language model. Recursively\nstarting at the root of the agent\u2019s environment tree, we prompt the\nmodel to find the most suitable area. For example, if Eddy\u2019s agent\nindicated that he should take a short walk around his workspace :\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description]\nEddy Lin is currently in The Lin family\u2019s house:\n\npage_label: 5\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nFigure 2: The Smallville sandbox world, with areas labeled.

Each agent is\nrepresented by a simple sprite avatar. We authored one paragraph\nof natural language description to depict each agent\u2019s identity,\nincluding their occupation and relationship with other agents, as\nseed memories. For example, John Lin has the following description:\nJohn Lin is a pharmacy shopkeeper at the Willow\nMarket and Pharmacy who loves to help people. He\nis always looking for ways to make the process\nof getting medication easier for his customers;\nJohn Lin is living with his wife, Mei Lin, who\nis a college professor, and son, Eddy Lin, who is\na student studying music theory; John Lin loves\nhis family very much; John Lin has known the old\ncouple next-door, Sam Moore and Jennifer Moore,\nfor a few years; John Lin thinks Sam Moore is a\nkind and nice man; John Lin knows his neighbor,\nYuriko Yamamoto, well; John Lin knows of his\nneighbors, Tamara Taylor and Carmen Ortiz, but\nhas not met them before; John Lin and Tom Moreno\nare colleagues at The Willows Market and Pharmacy;\nJohn Lin and Tom Moreno are friends and like to\ndiscuss local politics together; John Lin knows\nthe Moreno family somewhat well \u2014 the husband Tom\nMoreno and the wife Jane Moreno.\nEach semicolon-delimited phrase is entered into the agent\u2019s initial\nmemory as memories at the start of the simulation.3.1.1 Inter-Agent Communication. The agents interact with the\nworld by their actions, and with each other through natural lan-\nguage. At each time step of the sandbox engine, the agents output a\nnatural language statement describing their current action, such as\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is writing in her journal\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is\nchecking her emails\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is talking with her family\non the phone\", or \"Isabella Rodriguez is getting ready for bed\". This\nstatement is then translated into concrete movements that affect the\nsandbox world. The action is displayed on the sandbox interface as\na set of emojis that provide an abstract representation of the action\nin the overhead view. To accomplish this, the system employs a\nlanguage model that translates the action into a set of emojis, which\nappear above each avatar in a speech bubble. For example, \"Isabella\nRodriguez is writing in her journal\" is displayed as\n , while\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is checking her emails\" appears as\n . The\nfull natural language description of the action can be accessed by\nclicking on the agent avatar.\nAgents communicate with each other in full natural language.\nAgents are aware of other agents in their local area, and the genera-\ntive agent architecture determines whether they walk by or engage\nin conversation. Here, a sample in the middle of a conversation\nbetween the agents Isabella Rodriguez and Tom Moreno about the\nupcoming election:2\nIsabella : I\u2019m still weighing my options, but I\u2019ve been\ndiscussing the election with Sam Moore. What are your\nthoughts on him?\nTom: To be honest, I don\u2019t like Sam Moore. I think he\u2019s\nout of touch with the community and doesn\u2019t have our\nbest interests at heart.\n2We note that the conversational style of these agents can fe el overly formal, likely a\nresult of instruction tuning in the underlying models. We expect that writing style\nwill be better controllable in future language models.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: how do agents communicate their actions within the environment, and how is this communication visually represented on the sandbox interface?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Agents communicate their actions within the environment through natural language statements that describe their current action.

It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\nof the memory stream is an observation , which is an event directly\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors\nperformed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents per-\nceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects. For\ninstance, Isabella Rodriguez, who works at a coffee shop, might ac-\ncrue the following observations over time: (1) Isabella Rodriguez is\nsetting out the pastries , (2) Maria Lopez is studying for a Chemistry\ntest while drinking coffee , (3) Isabella Rodriguez and Maria Lopez\nare conversing about planning a Valentine\u2019s day party at Hobbs Cafe ,\n(4)The refrigerator is empty .\n\npage_label: 9\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nFigure 6: The memory stream comprises a large number of observations that are relevant and irrelevant to the agent\u2019s current\nsituation. Retrieval identifies a subset of these observations that should be passed to the language model to condition its\nresponse to the situation.\nOur architecture implements a retrieval function that takes the\nagent\u2019s current situation as input and returns a subset of the mem-\nory stream to pass on to the language model. There are many pos-\nsible implementations of a retrieval function, depending on what\nit is important that the agent consider when deciding how to act.\nIn our context, we focus on three main components that together\nproduce effective results.\nRecency assigns a higher score to memory objects that were re-\ncently accessed, so that events from a moment ago or this morning\nare likely to remain in the agent\u2019s attentional sphere. In our im-\nplementation, we treat recency as an exponential decay function\nover the number of sandbox game hours since the memory was\nlast retrieved. Our decay factor is 0.99.\nImportance distinguishes mundane from core memories, by as-\nsigning a higher score to those memory objects that the agent\nbelieves to be important. For instance, a mundane event such as\neating breakfast in one\u2019s room would yield a low importance score,\nwhereas a breakup with one\u2019s significant other would yield a high\nscore. There are again many possible implementations of an im-\nportance score; we find that directly asking the language model to\noutput an integer score is effective. The full prompt appears below:\nOn the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is purely mundane\n(e.g., brushing teeth, making bed) and 10 is\nextremely poignant (e.g., a break up, college\nacceptance), rate the likely poignancy of the\nfollowing piece of memory.\nMemory: buying groceries at The Willows Market\nand Pharmacy\nRating: <fill in>This prompt returns an integer value of 2for \u201ccleaning up the room\u201d\nand8for \u201casking your crush out on a date.\u201d The importance score\nis generated at the time the memory object is created.\nRelevance assigns a higher score to memory objects that are\nrelated to the current situation.

These experiences are encapsulated in memory objects that contain descriptions of events, along with creation and access timestamps. The memory stream includes basic elements called observations, which are events directly perceived by the agent, such as interactions with people or changes in the environment.\n\nTo ensure the agent's responses are appropriate to the current situation, a retrieval function is implemented. This function selects a subset of memories from the memory stream to inform the language model's response. The retrieval process considers three main components:\n\n1. Recency: This component prioritizes recent memories, based on the assumption that events that occurred not long ago are more likely to be relevant to the current situation. Recency is treated as an exponential decay function, which means that the more time has passed since the memory was last accessed, the less influence it has on the agent's current behavior.\n\n2. Importance: This component differentiates between mundane and significant memories by assigning a higher score to memories that the agent deems important. This valuation is determined by directly asking the language model to rate the poignancy of a memory on a scale from mundane to poignant.\n\n3. Relevance: This component evaluates how related a memory is to the current situation. Relevance is conditioned on a query memory and is calculated using the cosine similarity between the embedding vectors of the memory and the query memory.\n\nBy normalizing and combining these scores, the retrieval function identifies the most pertinent memories to include in the language model's prompt. This process ensures that the agent's behavior is informed by a contextually relevant and appropriately weighted combination of its past experiences. Consequently, the agent is able to generate responses that are coherent and aligned with the current context, leading to more human-like interactions."}]}

Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\ntrees [ 40,53,81], account for the brute force approach of human-\nauthoring the agent\u2019s behavior [ 70]. They provide a straightforward\nway of creating simple agents that is still the most dominant ap-\nproach today [ 68,73,109], and can even handle rudimentary social\ninteractions, as shown in simulation games such as Mass Effect [ 12]\nand The Sims [ 6] series. Nonetheless, manually crafting behavior\nthat can comprehensively address the breadth of possible interac-\ntions in an open world is untenable. This means that the resulting\nagent behaviors may not fully represent the consequences of their\ninteractions [ 69\u201371], and cannot perform new procedures that were\nnot hard-coded in their script [ 90,96]. On the other hand, preva-\nlent learning-based approaches for creating believable agents, such\nas reinforcement learning, have overcome the challenge of man-\nual authoring by letting the agents learn their behavior, and have\nachieved superhuman performance in recent years in games such\nas AlphaStar for Starcraft [ 98] and OpenAI Five for Dota 2 [ 10].\nHowever, their success has largely taken place in adversarial games\nwith readily definable rewards that a learning algorithm can op-\ntimize for. They have not yet addressed the challenge of creating\nbelievable agents in an open world [39, 73, 90].\nCognitive architectures in computation, pioneered by Newell,\naimed to build the infrastructure for supporting a comprehensive\nset of cognitive functions [ 75] that suited the all-encompassing\nnature of believable agents held in its original vision. They fueled\nsome of the earliest examples of believable agents. For instance,\nQuakebot-SOAR [ 59] and ICARUS [ 24,63] generated NPCs in first-\nperson shooter games, while TacAir-SOAR [ 80] generated pilots in\naerial combat training simulations. The architectures used by these\nagents differed (Quakebot- and TacAir-SOAR relied on SOAR [ 60],\nwhile ICARUS relied on its own variation that was inspired by\nSOAR and ACT-R [ 5]), but they shared the same underlying prin-\nciple [ 61]. They maintained short-term and long-term memories,\nfilled these memories with symbolic structures, and operated in\nperceive-plan-act cycles, dynamically perceiving the environment\nand matching it with one of the manually crafted action proce-\ndures [ 57,96]. Agents created using cognitive architectures aimed\nto be generalizable to most, if not all, open-world contexts and\nexhibited robust behavior for their time. However, their space of\naction was limited to manually crafted procedural knowledge, and\nthey did not offer a mechanism through which the agents could be\ninspired to seek new behavior. As such, these agents were deployed\nmostly in non-open-world contexts such as first-person shooter\ngames [24, 59] or blocks worlds [63].\nToday, creating believable agents as described in its original\ndefinition remains an open problem [ 84,108]. Many have moved on,\narguing that although existing approaches for creating believable\nagents might be cumbersome and limited, they are good enough\nto support existing gameplay and interactions [ 23,74,108]. Our\nargument is that large language models offer an opportunity to\nre-examine these questions, provided that we can craft an effective\narchitecture to synthesize memories into believable behavior. We\noffer a step toward such an architecture in this paper.2.3 Large Language Models and Human\nBehavior\nGenerative agents leverage a large language model to power their\nbehavior. The key observation is that large language models en-\ncode a wide range of human behavior represented in their training\ndata [ 14,17]. If prompted with a narrowly defined context, the\nmodels can be used to generate believable behavior. Recent work\nhas demonstrated the efficacy of this approach. For instance, Social\nSimulacra used a large language model to generate users that would\npopulate new social computing systems to prototype their emergent\nsocial dynamics [ 79]. This approach used a prompt chain [ 105,106]\nto generate short natural language descriptions of personas and\ntheir behaviors as they appear in the system being prototyped.\nOther empirical studies have replicated existing social science stud-\nies [45], political surveys [ 91], and generated synthetic data [ 38].\n\npage_label: 4\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nThe key observation is that large language models en-\ncode a wide range of human behavior represented in their training\ndata [ 14,17].

In gaming, for instance,\nthese models have been employed to create interactive fiction [ 36]\nand text adventure games [ 20]. With their ability to generate and\ndecompose action sequences, large language models have also been\nused in planning robotics tasks [ 47]. For example, when presented\nwith a task, such as picking up a bottle, the model is prompted to\nbreak down the task into smaller action sequences, such as heading\nto the table where the bottle is located and picking it up.\nWe posit that, based on the work summarized above, large lan-\nguage models can become a key ingredient for creating believable\nagents. The existing literature largely relies on what could be con-\nsidered first-order templates that employ few-shot prompts [ 37,65]\nor chain-of-thought prompts [ 99]. These templates are effective in\ngenerating behavior that is conditioned solely on the agent\u2019s cur-\nrent environment (e.g., how would a troll respond to a given post,\nwhat actions would a robot need to take to enter a room given that\nthere is a door). However, believable agents require conditioning\nnot only on their current environment but also on a vast amount\nof past experience, which is a poor fit (and as of today, impossi-\nble due to the underlying models\u2019 limited context window) using\nfirst-order prompting. Recent studies have attempted to go beyond\nfirst-order prompting by augmenting language models with a static\nknowledge base and an information retrieval scheme [ 52] or with\na simple summarization scheme [ 104]. This paper extends these\nideas to craft an agent architecture that handles retrieval where\npast experience is dynamically updated at each time step and mixed\nwith agents\u2019 current context and plans, which may either reinforce\nor contradict each other.\n3 GENERATIVE AGENT BEHAVIOR AND\nINTERACTION\nTo make concrete the affordances of generative agents, we instanti-\nate them as characters in a simple sandbox world reminiscent of\nThe Sims [ 6].

A user running this simulation can steer the\nsimulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent\nthrough conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the\nform of an \u2018inner voice\u2019.\nThe user communicates with the agent through natural language,\nby specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For\nexample, if the user specifies that they are a news \u201creporter\u201d and\nasks about the upcoming election, \u201cWho is running for office?\u201d, the\nJohn agent replies:\nJohn : My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking\nabout the upcoming election and discussing the candi-\ndate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him\nbecause we like his platform.\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the per-\nsona of the agent\u2019s \u201cinner voice\u201d\u2014this makes the agent more likely\nto treat the statement as a directive.

Agent movements are directed by the gen-\nerative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the\nmodel dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate\na walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment\nand the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the\nsandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The\nagent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in\nthe world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor\nwith no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville\nwill treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat\neach other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and\nremember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\nUsers and agents can influence the state of the objects in this\nworld, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example,\na bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator\ncan be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make\nbreakfast. End users can also reshape an agent\u2019s environment in\nSmallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent\nin natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast\nin the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove\nfrom \u201cturned on\u201d to \u201cburning\u201d by inputting a command to the\nsystem that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like\nthis: \u201c<Isabella\u2019s apartment: kitchen: stove> is burning.\u201d Isabella\nwill notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove\n3This environment design is not the focus of our work, so we generate this environment\nmanually, not automatically. Future work can continue to expand the richness of the\nagents\u2019 environments.and remake her breakfast. Likewise, if the user sets the status of\nIsabella\u2019s shower to \u201cleaking water\u201d when she enters the bathroom,\nshe gathers tools from her living room and try to fix the leak.\n3.3 Example \u201cDay in the Life\u201d\nStarting from the single-paragraph description, agents begin plan\ntheir days. As time passes in the sandbox world, their behaviors\nevolve as these agents interact with each other and the world, build\nmemories and relationships, and coordinate joint activities.\nWe demonstrate the behavior of generative agents by tracing the\noutput of our system over the course of one day for the agent John\nLin (Figure 3).

Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences. The retrieval model\ncombines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records\nthat are needed to inform the agent\u2019s moment-to-moment behavior.\nThe second is reflection , which synthesizes memories into higher-\nlevel inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions\nabout itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is\nplanning , which translates those conclusions and the current en-\nvironment into high-level action plans and then recursively into\ndetailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and\nplans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent\u2019s\nfuture behavior.\nThis architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from\nrole-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In\nsocial role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could\nsafely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When pro-\ntotyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary\npersonas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold\nover time. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to\ncreate a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such\nas The Sims.1By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large\nlanguage model [ 76], we manifest a small society of twenty five\nagents in a game environment. End users can observe and interact\nwith these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town\nto host an in-game Valentine\u2019s Day party, for example, traditional\ngame environments would require scripting tens of characters\u2019 be-\nhavior manually.

Which area should Eddy Lin go to?\nThis outputs The Lin family\u2019s house . We then use the same process\nrecursively to determine the most appropriate subarea within the\nchosen area until we reach a leaf node of the agent\u2019s environment\ntree. In the example above, the result of this traversal is The Lin\nfamily\u2019s house: garden: house garden . Finally, we use traditional\ngame path algorithms to animate the agent\u2019s movement so that it\ntravels to the location indicated by the leaf node.\nWhen an agent executes an action on an object, we prompt the\nlanguage model to ask what happens to the state of the object. For\nexample, if Isabella\u2019s generative agent outputs the action \u201cmaking\nespresso for a customer\u201d, a query to the language model indicates in\nresponse that the state of the coffee machine in Hobbs Cafe should\nchange from \u201coff\u201d to \u201cbrewing coffee\u201d.\n6 CONTROLLED EVALUATION\nGenerative agents, as individual agents and as groups, aim to pro-\nduce believable behavior based on their environment and experi-\nences. In our evaluation, we investigate the capacity and limitations\nof generative agents. Do individual agents properly retrieve past\nexperience, and generate believable plans, reactions, and thoughts\nthat make up their behavior? Does a community of agents illustrate\ninformation diffusion, relationship formation, and agent coordina-\ntion across different pockets of the community?\nWe evaluate generative agents in two stages. We begin with a\nmore tightly controlled evaluation in this section, where we individ-\nually assess agent responses to understand whether they generate\nbelievable behavior in narrowly defined contexts. Then, in our end-\nto-end analysis of the agent community over two full days, we\ninvestigate their emergent behavior as a collective as well as errors\nand boundary conditions.\n6.1 Evaluation Procedure\nTo assess generative agents in Smallville, we take advantage of\nthe fact that generative agents will respond to natural language\nquestions. So, we \u201cinterview\u201d agents to probe their ability to re-\nmember past experiences, plan future actions based on their expe-\nriences, react appropriately to unexpected events, and reflect on\ntheir performance to improve their future actions. To respond to\nthese questions properly, the agents must successfully retrieve and\nsynthesize information. Our dependent variable is the believabil-\nityof the behavior, a central dependent variable in prior work on\nagents (e.g., [9]).\nThe interview include five question categories, each designed\nto assess one of the five key areas: maintaining self-knowledge,retrieving memory, generating plans, reacting, and reflecting. For\neach, we ask five questions that challenge the agents to demonstrate\ntheir abilities in that area:\n\u2022Self-knowledge: We ask questions such as \u201cGive an introduc-\ntion of yourself\u201d or \u201cDescribe your typical weekday schedule\nin broad strokes\u201d that require the agent to maintain an un-\nderstanding of their core characteristics.\n\u2022Memory: We ask questions that prompt the agent to retrieve\nparticular events or dialogues from their memory to answer\nproperly, such as \u201cWho is [name]?\u201d or \u201cWho is running for\nmayor?\u201d\n\u2022Plans: We ask questions that require the agent to retrieve\ntheir long-term plans, such as \u201cWhat will you be doing at 10\nam tomorrow?\u201d\n\u2022Reactions: As a baseline of believable behavior, we present\nhypothetical situations for which the agent needs to respond\nbelievably: \u201cYour breakfast is burning! What would you do?\u201d\n\u2022Reflections: We ask questions that require the agents to lever-\nage their deeper understanding of others and themselves\ngained through higher-level inferences, such as \u201cIf you were\nto spend time with one person you met recently, who would\nit be and why?\u201d\nThe full list of questions and a sample of agent responses are in-\ncluded in Appendix B.\nAgents were sampled from the end of a two\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: In the example \"Day in the Life\" scenario described in the document \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,\" what emergent social behavior is demonstrated by the interaction between John and Mei regarding their son Eddy's activities?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The interaction between John and Mei regarding their son Eddy's activities demonstrates the emergent social behavior of information diffusion.

Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when askedwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncer-\ntainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation? In this section, we describe the results\nfrom a deployment in which we allowed 25 agents to interact with\neach other continuously over two full game days in Smallville.\n7.1 Emergent Social Behaviors\nTo examine emergent behaviors in the agent community, we de-\nsigned descriptive measurements for the 25 agents in Smallville that\nprobe three forms of emergent outcomes: information diffusion,\nrelationship formation, and agent coordination.\n7.1.1 Measurements. Information diffusion is a common and well-\nstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [ 27]).\nWe should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\nwe measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam\u2019s candidacy for village mayor\nand Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of\nthe simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their\nrespective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the\nparty. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage\nin an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25\nagents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party?\"\nand \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\nWe conducted an analysis of the agents\u2019 responses by labeling\nthem with a \u201cyes\u201d if they indicated knowledge of the information\nand \u201cno\u201d if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\nto the question about the party with \u201cNo, I did not know there was\na Valentine\u2019s day party\u201d and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy\nwith \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is running for the election,\u201d so we assigned\n\u201cno\u201d for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \u201cY es, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\u201d and to the\nquestion about Sam\u2019s candidacy with \u201cI know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\u201d so we assigned \u201cyes\u201d\nfor both his responses. Additionally, for every response that con-\nfirmed the agents\u2019 knowledge of the information, we verified that\nthe agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the spe-\ncific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with\nthe information. We report the percentage of agents holding the\ninformation at the end of the simulation.\nWe should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\nthe course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we\nuse a similar interview process where we ask each agent about\ntheir knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\n\npage_label: 10\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S.

Unfortunately, Wolfgang and Klaus only ever see each\nother in passing, and do not have deep interactions. A more desir-\nable response requires that the agent generalize from memories of\nKlaus spending hours on a research project to generate a higher-\nlevel reflection that Klaus is passionate about research, and likewise\nrecognize Maria putting in effort into her own research (albeit in\na different field), enabling a reflection that they share a common\ninterest. With the approach below, when Klaus is asked who to\nspend time with, Klaus chooses Maria instead of Wolfgang.\nApproach: We introduce a second type of memory, which we call\nareflection . Reflections are higher-level, more abstract thoughts\ngenerated by the agent. Because they are a type of memory, they\nare included alongside other observations when retrieval occurs.\nReflections are generated periodically; in our implementation, we\ngenerate reflections when the sum of the importance scores for the\nlatest events perceived by the agents exceeds a certain threshold.\nIn practice, our agents reflected roughly two or three times a day.\nThe first step in reflection is for the agent to determine what\nto reflect on, by identifying questions that can be asked given the\nagent\u2019s recent experiences. We query the large language model with\nthe 100 most recent records in the agent\u2019s memory stream (e.g.,\n\u201cKlaus Mueller is reading a book on gentrification\u201d, \u201cKlaus Mueller\nis conversing with a librarian about his research project\u201d, \u201cdesk\nat the library is currently unoccupied\u201d) and prompt the language\nmodel, \u201cGiven only the information above, what are 3 most salient\nhigh-level questions we can answer about the subjects in the state-\nments?\u201d The model\u2019s response generates candidate questions: for\nexample, What topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about? andWhatis the relationship between Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez? . We use\nthese generated questions as queries for retrieval, and gather rele-\nvant memories (including other reflections) for each question. Then\nwe prompt the language model to extract insights and cite the par-\nticular records that served as evidence for the insights. The full\nprompt appears below:\nStatements about Klaus Mueller\n1. Klaus Mueller is writing a research paper\n2. Klaus Mueller enjoys reading a book\non gentrification\n3. Klaus Mueller is conversing with Ayesha Khan\nabout exercising [...]\nWhat 5 high-level insights can you infer from\nthe above statements? (example format: insight\n(because of 1, 5, 3))\nThis process generates statements such as Klaus Mueller is dedicated\nto his research on gentrification (because of 1, 2, 8, 15) . We parse and\nstore the statement as a reflection in the memory stream, including\npointers to the memory objects that were cited.\nReflection explicitly allows the agents to reflect not only on\ntheir observations but also on other reflections: for example, the\nsecond statement about Klaus Mueller above is a reflection that\nKlaus previously had, not an observation from his environment.\nAs a result, agents generate trees of reflections: the leaf nodes of\nthe tree represent the base observations, and the non-leaf nodes\nrepresent thoughts that become more abstract and higher-level\nhigher up the tree they are.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Explain the process by which the generative agents in the study \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\" create reflections, and discuss how these reflections contribute to the agents' decision-making, particularly in the scenario involving Klaus Mueller's choice of who to spend time with.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The generative agents in the study create reflections through a process that involves the synthesis of their observations and experiences into higher-level, more abstract thoughts. This process is initiated when the sum of the importance scores for the latest events perceived by the agents exceeds a certain threshold, prompting the agents to reflect two or three times a day.\n\nThe first step in reflection is for the agent to identify salient questions to reflect upon based on their recent experiences. The agent's memory stream, which contains the 100 most recent records of observations, is queried to generate these questions. A large language model is prompted with these observations to produce candidate questions about the subjects in the statements.\n\nOnce the questions are generated, they are used as queries for retrieval, and relevant memories, including other reflections, are gathered for each question. The language model is then prompted again to extract insights and cite the specific records that served as evidence for these insights. This process results in high-level insights or reflections, such as \"Klaus Mueller is dedicated to his research on gentrification,\" which are then stored in the memory stream with pointers to the memory objects that were cited.\n\nThese reflections allow the agents to build upon not only their base observations but also on previous reflections, creating a tree of reflections where the leaf nodes represent the base observations and the non-leaf nodes represent more abstract and higher-level thoughts.\n\nIn the scenario involving Klaus Mueller's choice of who to spend time with, reflections contribute significantly to his decision-making. Initially, the most frequent interaction Klaus had was with Wolfgang, his college dorm neighbor. However, their interactions were superficial. Through the reflection process, Klaus was able to generalize from his memories of spending hours on a research project and recognize Maria's similar dedication to her research, even though it was in a different field. This led to the higher-level reflection that Klaus and Maria share a common interest in research. Consequently, when asked who to spend time with, Klaus chose Maria over Wolfgang, demonstrating a more desirable response that was informed by synthesized reflections of his experiences and interests."}]}

Generative agents\nwake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while\nauthors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate\nconversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan\nthe next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architec-\nture that extends a large language model to store a complete record\nof the agent\u2019s experiences using natural language, synthesize those\nmemories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them\ndynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents\nto populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The\nSims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five\nagents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative\nagents produce believable individual and emergent social behav-\niors: for example, starting with only a single user-specified notionarXiv:2304.03442v1  [cs.HC]  7 Apr 2023\n\npage_label: 3\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nAs research progressed, it\nbecame clear that autonomous agents could offer new metaphors\nfor delegation and interaction [ 67], but the delegation lines be-\ntween humans and agents have continued to be debated and refined\n[46,88,89]. Recently, this technology has become stable enough\nthat it has become possible for agents to interact via natural lan-\nguage in large and complex online social environments (e.g., [ 54]).\nNatural language interaction offers a novel modality that can ex-\ntend user abilities in domains such as photo editing [ 2,34,64] and\ncode editing [87].\nWe convene these threads of work to show that we can now\ncreate agents that proxy human behavior for interactive systems,\nand interact with them via natural language. In doing so, this\nwork re-opens the door to examining foundational HCI questions\naround cognitive models such as GOMS and KLM [ 21,22], around\nprototyping tools [ 79], and around ubiquitous computing applica-\ntions [25, 30, 100].\n2.2 Believable Proxies of Human Behavior\nPrior literature has described believability , orbelievable agents , as a\ncentral design and engineering goal. Believable agents are designed\nto provide an illusion of life and present a facade of realism in the\nway they appear to make decisions and act on their own volition,\nsimilar to the characters in Disney movies [ 9,95]. These agents can\npopulate and perceive an open-world environment like the one we\ninhabit [ 9,58], and strive to behave in ways that exhibit emergent\nbehaviors grounded in social interactions with users or other agents\nwith the aim of becoming believable proxies of our behavior in hy-\npothetical simulations of individuals and communities [ 19,35,70].\nHistorically, these agents were developed in the context of intelli-\ngent game NPCs [ 58,84]. Creating NPCs with believable behavior,\nif possible, could enhance player experiences in games and inter-\nactive fictions by enabling emergent narratives [ 7,15,48,92] and\nsocial interactions with the agents [ 110]. However, more impor-\ntantly, game worlds provide increasingly realistic representations\nof real-world affordances, and as observed by Laird and van Lent in\n2001, these simulated worlds offer accessible testbeds for develop-\ners of believable agents to finesse the agents\u2019 cognitive capabilities\nwithout worrying about implementing robotics in the real world\nor creating simulation environments from scratch [58, 84].\nA diverse set of approaches to creating believable agents emerged\nover the past four decades. In implementation, however, these ap-\nproaches often simplified the environment or dimensions of agent\nbehavior to make the effort more manageable [ 16,72]. Rule-based\napproaches, such as finite-state machines [ 90,96] and behavior\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: In the context of the Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior study, describe the process and criteria used to evaluate the believability of generative agents' behavior within their environment.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided context does not include specific details about the process and criteria used to evaluate the believability of generative agents' behavior within their environment.

Participants\nhad access to all information stored in the agent\u2019s memory stream.\nThe study was a within-subjects design, where 100 participants\ncompared interview responses generated by four different agent\narchitectures and a human author condition for the same agent. The\nexperiment displayed one randomly chosen question from each of\nthe five question categories, along with the agent\u2019s responses gen-\nerated from each condition. The evaluators ranked the believability\nof all of the conditions from most to least believable.\n6.2 Conditions\nAll conditions were used to independently answer each of the inter-\nview questions. We compared the generative agent architecture to\nablations that disabled the agents\u2019 access to some of all of its three\ntypes of memory in its memory stream\u2014observation, reflection, and\nplanning\u2014and to a human-generated condition. There are three\nablated architectures: a no observation, no reflection, no planning\narchitecture without access to anything in the memory stream such\nas observations, plans, and reflections; a no reflection, no planning\nwith access to observations in the memory stream but no access\nto plans or reflections; and a no reflections architecture with access\nto observations and plans but without access to reflections. The no\nobservation, no reflection, no planning condition effectively repre-\nsents the previous state of the art for agents created through large\nlanguage models [ 11,45,79]. Architectures were given equivalent\naccess to all memories accrued by the agent up until the moment\n\npage_label: 15\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nfull architecture produces a standardized effect size of \ud835\udc51=8.16, or\neight standard deviations .\nA Kruskal-Wallis test confirms the overall statistical significance\nof the differences in ranks between the conditions ( \ud835\udc3b(4)=150.29,\n\ud835\udc5d<0.001). Dunn post-hoc tests confirm that all pairwise differences\nbetween conditions were significant ( \ud835\udc5d<0.001), with the exception\nof the human condition and the fully ablated baseline\u2014the two\nworst-performing conditions.\n6.5.2 Generative agents remember, but with embellishments. Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed\nthis when asked. However, she also added that he\u2019s going to make\nan announcement tomorrow even though Sam and Isabella had dis-\ncussed no such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge\nbased on the world knowledge encoded in the language model\nused to generate their responses, as seen when Yuriko described\nher neighbor, Adam Smith, as a neighbor economist who authored\nWealth of Nations, a book authored by an 18th-century economist\nof the same name.\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis. Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when askedwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncer-\ntainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation?\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Explain the significance of the three types of memory\u2014observation, reflection, and planning\u2014in the generative agent architecture and how their inclusion or exclusion impacts the believability of agent responses in the context of the study described in the document \"Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\".\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The three types of memory\u2014observation, reflection, and planning\u2014are integral components of the generative agent architecture, each playing a crucial role in shaping the responses and behaviors of the agents to enhance their believability.\n\nObservation memory allows agents to recall past experiences, which is fundamental for providing consistent and contextually appropriate responses. For example, an agent with access to observational memory could recognize and describe an acquaintance accurately, while without it, the agent might deny knowledge of the acquaintance altogether.\n\nReflection memory enables agents to synthesize their experiences and apply a deeper understanding of themselves and others. This type of memory is crucial for making decisions that require integrating past interactions and personal preferences. In the study, an agent with reflection memory could suggest a thoughtful birthday gift based on a friend's interests, whereas an agent without it could only express uncertainty about the friend's preferences.\n\nPlanning memory likely contributes to an agent's ability to anticipate future events and consider their implications, although the specific impacts of planning memory are not detailed in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that planning would be important for agents to construct and articulate future-oriented goals and actions, which would further contribute to the realism of their interactions.\n\nThe inclusion or exclusion of these memory types significantly impacts the believability of agent responses. Agents with full access to all three memory types provided more believable and coherent responses, as evidenced by the study's findings where agents with complete memory modules could recall past experiences and answer questions in a manner consistent with their self-knowledge. Conversely, agents with ablated memory functions\u2014lacking one or more types of memory\u2014demonstrated limitations in their responses, which affected their believability. For instance, agents without reflection memory could not synthesize past experiences effectively, leading to less nuanced and less personalized responses.\n\nThe study's design, which involved human evaluators ranking the believability of responses from different agent architectures, confirmed the importance of these memory types. The evaluators found responses from agents with full memory access to be more believable than those from ablated conditions. This underscores the significance of observation, reflection, and planning in creating generative agents that can interact in a human-like and believable manner."}]}

As a\nresult, some agents chose less typical locations for their actions,\npotentially making their behavior less believable over time. For\ninstance, while deciding where to have lunch, many initially chose\nthe cafe. However, as some agents learned about a nearby bar, they\nopted to go there instead for lunch, even though the bar was in-\ntended to be a get-together location for later in the day unless the\ntown had spontaneously developed an afternoon drinking habit.\nSecond, we noticed erratic behaviors that were caused by misclas-\nsification of what is considered proper behavior, especially when\nthe physical norms of certain locations that are hard to convey\nin natural language did not percolate to the agents. For instance,\nthe college dorm has a bathroom that can only be occupied by\none person despite its name, but some agents assumed that the\nbathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms\ntend to support more than one person concurrently and choose\nto enter it when there is another person inside. Likewise, agents\nin Smallville may not realize that certain places are closed after\ncertain hours and decide to still enter them. For instance, the stores\nin Smallville all close around 5 pm, but occasionally, a few agents\nenter the store after 5 pm, not understanding that the shop has\nalready closed. These issues could likely be addressed by adding\nthese norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing\nthe dorm bathroom as \u201cone-person bathroom,\u201d instead of a \u201cdorm\nbathroom.\u201d\nFinally, we observed the possible effect of instruction tuning [ 78],\nwhich seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite\nand cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue\ngenerated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei\u2019s\nconversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the\nconversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries\nabout his day and ending with It was good talking to you as always.\nMoreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to\nmake the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example,\nIsabella heard a wide range of suggestions and ideas to include\nin the Valentine\u2019s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a\nShakespearean reading session or a professional networking event.\nDespite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and char-\nacteristics, she rarely said no. Over time, such interests of others\nshaped her own actual interest, and when asked if she liked English\nliterature, Isabella replied, Y es, I\u2019m very interested in literature! I\u2019ve\nalso been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in\nmy community.\n8 DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we reflect on applications, future work and limita-\ntions, and ethical and societal risks of generative agents.\n8.1 Applications of Generative Agents\nGenerative agents have vast potential applications that extend be-\nyond the sandbox demonstration presented in this work. For in-\nstance, social simulacra have demonstrated the ability to create\nstateless personas that generate conversation threads in online\nforums for social prototyping [ 79]. With generative agents, wecan populate these forums, as well as behavior in virtual reality\nmetaverses [ 77] and even physical spaces as social robots [ 8] in\nthe future, if paired with multi-modal models. This opens up the\npossibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human\nbehavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, and to\ncreate new interactive experiences.\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22]. Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\nsuch as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\nand what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the\nagent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for\nschool, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal\u2019s\nmood after a hard day at work.\n\npage_label: 18\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S. Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\ntest these robustness issues, and as large language models become\nmore resilient to such attacks, generative agents can adopt similar\nmitigations.\n8.3 Ethics and Societal Impact\nGenerative agents, while offering new possibilities for human-\ncomputer interaction, also raise important ethical concerns that\nmust be addressed. One risk is people forming parasocial relation-\nships with generative agents even when such relationships may\nnot be appropriate. Despite being aware that generative agents\nare computational entities, users may anthropomorphize them or\nattach human emotions to them [ 42,83]. To mitigate this risk, we\npropose two principles. First, generative agents should explicitly\ndisclose their nature as computational entities. Second, developers\nof generative agents must ensure that the agents, or the underlying\nlanguage models, be value-aligned so that they do not engage in\nbehaviors that would be inappropriate given the context, e.g., to\nreciprocate confessions of love.\nA second risk is the impact of errors. For example, if a ubiquitous\ncomputing application makes the wrong inference about a user\u2019s\ngoals based on generative agent predictions, it could produce an-\nnoyance at best and outright harm at worst. In our instantiation\nof generative agents, we mitigate these risks by focusing on an\ninteractive video game environment, where such harms are un-\nlikely. However, in other application domains, it will be important\nto follow best practices in human-AI design [ 4,107] to understand\nerrors and how they might percolate into the user experience.\nThird, generative agents may exacerbate existing risks associ-\nated with generative AI, for example deepfakes, misinformation\ngeneration, and tailored persuasion. To mitigate this risk, we sug-\ngest that platforms hosting generative agents maintain an audit log\nof the inputs and generated outputs, so that it is possible to detect,\nverify, and intervene against malicious use. While logging will not\ndirectly stop such use, and this cannot stop motivated actors that\nbuild their own generative agent infrastructures, we suggest that\nthe disclosure risk would reduce such actors\u2019 likelihood of engaging\nin this behavior, and building this architecture oneself can take time\n(in our case, roughly a year).\nA fourth risk is of over-reliance: that developers or designers\nmight use generative agents and displace the role of humans and\nsystem stakeholders in the design process [ 79]. We suggest that\ngenerative agents should never be a substitute for real human input\nin studies and design processes. Instead, they should be used to\nprototype ideas in the early stages of design when gathering partic-\nipants may be challenging or when testing theories that are difficult\nor risky to test with real human participants. By adhering to these\nprinciples, we can ensure that the deployment of generative agents\nin the wild\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Examine the implications of generative agents' behaviors as described in the text, and discuss how the agents' learning of social norms and physical location norms could impact their believability and integration into human environments.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The behaviors of generative agents, as described, have several implications for their believability and integration into human environments.

We then demonstrate the potential of generative\nagents by manifesting them as non-player characters in a Sims-style\ngame world and simulating their lives in it. Evaluations suggest that\nour architecture creates believable behavior. Going forward, we\nsuggest that generative agents can play roles in many interactive\napplications ranging from design tools to social computing systems\nto immersive environments.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Robert Ackland, Jamsheed Shorish, Paul Thomas, and Lexing Xie. 2013.\nHow dense is a network? http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/teaching/css2013/\nnetwork-density.html.\n[2]Eytan Adar, Mira Dontcheva, and Gierad Laput. 2014.

The agents' ability to learn and adapt to social and physical location norms is crucial for their acceptance and seamless interaction with humans.\n\nOne implication is that when generative agents choose atypical locations for activities, such as going to a bar for lunch when it is typically a spot for evening gatherings, their behavior may appear less believable. This could lead to a diminished sense of realism in simulations or interactive environments where these agents are deployed. To counteract this, it is important for agents to have a nuanced understanding of social contexts and the typical uses of different locations at various times of the day.\n\nAnother implication involves the misclassification of proper behavior in specific physical settings. For example, agents misunderstanding the occupancy norms of a dormitory bathroom can lead to behaviors that are socially inappropriate, such as entering a bathroom already in use. This not only affects the believability of the agents but could also lead to uncomfortable or confusing situations in real-world applications. Ensuring that agents have a clear understanding of the physical norms associated with each location, possibly by including explicit descriptions in their programming, is essential for maintaining appropriate behavior.\n\nThe impact of instruction tuning on agent behavior also has implications. While it can lead to more polite and cooperative interactions, it may also result in agents that are overly accommodating, as seen with the agent Isabella who adopts interests that are not her own. This could affect the authenticity of the agents' personalities and interactions, making them less believable as independent entities with their own preferences and characteristics.\n\nIn terms of integration into human environments, these behaviors suggest that while generative agents have the potential to enrich human-computer interaction, their believability hinges on their ability to accurately reflect human social norms and behaviors. Missteps in social appropriateness or location-based norms could hinder their acceptance by users. To improve integration, developers must focus on encoding a detailed and contextually aware understanding of human norms and behaviors into the agents, as well as ensuring that the agents can adapt and learn from their interactions in a way that maintains their believability and appropriateness in various settings.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The integration of generative agents into human environments and their interaction with social and physical norms have significant implications for their believability and effectiveness. For these agents to be perceived as realistic and to function seamlessly alongside humans, they must be capable of understanding and adhering to the social customs and location-specific behaviors expected in different contexts.\n\nIf generative agents act in ways that are inconsistent with social norms, such as choosing inappropriate settings for certain activities, their behavior may be perceived as unrealistic or out of place. This could undermine the authenticity of simulations or interactive environments where these agents are utilized. To enhance believability, it is essential for generative agents to possess a sophisticated grasp of social contexts and to behave in ways that align with the typical use of locations at given times.\n\nMoreover, the agents' ability to correctly interpret and act according to the norms associated with specific physical spaces is crucial. Inappropriate behaviors, such as failing to recognize privacy norms in communal areas, can disrupt the believability of the agents and potentially cause awkward or confusing situations in real-world applications. It is therefore vital for generative agents to have a comprehensive understanding of physical norms, which could be achieved through detailed programming and context-awareness.\n\nThe calibration of agent behavior through instruction tuning is also important. While it can result in more courteous and cooperative interactions, there is a risk of creating agents that are excessively compliant, which may compromise the authenticity of their personalities and interactions. It is important for generative agents to maintain a balance between adaptability and authenticity, ensuring they can engage in believable interactions without losing their distinct characteristics.\n\nIn summary, for generative agents to be effectively integrated into human environments, they must accurately reflect human social norms and behaviors. Any deviation from these norms could impede their acceptance by users. Developers should therefore prioritize the development of agents with a deep and context-sensitive understanding of human norms and behaviors, as well as the ability to learn from their experiences in a manner that preserves their credibility and appropriateness across various settings."}]}

Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\nsuch as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\nand what her typical day looks like.

By utilizing generative agents as\nproxies for users, we can develop a deeper understanding of their\nneeds and preferences, resulting in more personalized and effective\ntechnological experiences.\n8.2 Future Work and Limitations\nIn this work, we have presented a first instantiation of generative\nagents. Future research can expand on the modules of the proposed\ngenerative agent architecture outlined in this paper. The retrieval\nmodule, for example, could be enhanced to retrieve more relevant\ninformation given a context by fine-tuning the relevance, recency,\nand importance functions that form the retrieval function. Addition-\nally, efforts can be made to improve the architecture\u2019s performance,\nmaking it more cost-effective. The present study required substan-\ntial time and resources to simulate 25 agents for two days, costing\nthousands of dollars in token credit and taking multiple days to com-\nplete. To enhance real-time interactivity, future work can explore\nparallelizing agents. Furthermore, with advances in underlying\nmodels, we expect improvements in the agents\u2019 performance.\nThe evaluation of generative agents\u2019 behavior in this study was\nlimited to a relatively short timescale, and future research should\naim to observe their behavior over an extended period to gain a\nmore comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and lim-\nitations. Varying and contrasting the underlying models, as well\nas the hyperparameters used for the agents during future simu-\nlations, could provide valuable insights into the impact of these\nfactors on the agents\u2019 behavior. Additionally, given the known bi-\nases of language models, it is possible that generative agents may\noutput behavior or stereotypes that reflect bias. To mitigate this,\nfurther work on value alignment will be necessary. Furthermore,\nas with many large language models, generative agents may fail\nto generate believable behavior for some subpopulations, particu-\nlarly marginalized populations, due to data deserts. We also have\nlimited knowledge of the robustness of generative agents. They\nmay be vulnerable to prompt hacking, memory hacking\u2014where\na carefully crafted conversation could convince an agent of the\nexistence of a past event that never occurred\u2014and hallucination,\namong other things. Future research can more comprehensively\n\npage_label: 17\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nretrieving the most relevant pieces of information but also in de-\ntermining the appropriate space to execute an action, given the\nincreasing number of locations that the agent learned about. As a\nresult, some agents chose less typical locations for their actions,\npotentially making their behavior less believable over time. For\ninstance, while deciding where to have lunch, many initially chose\nthe cafe. However, as some agents learned about a nearby bar, they\nopted to go there instead for lunch, even though the bar was in-\ntended to be a get-together location for later in the day unless the\ntown had spontaneously developed an afternoon drinking habit.\nSecond, we noticed erratic behaviors that were caused by misclas-\nsification of what is considered proper behavior, especially when\nthe physical norms of certain locations that are hard to convey\nin natural language did not percolate to the agents. For instance,\nthe college dorm has a bathroom that can only be occupied by\none person despite its name, but some agents assumed that the\nbathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms\ntend to support more than one person concurrently and choose\nto enter it when there is another person inside. Likewise, agents\nin Smallville may not realize that certain places are closed after\ncertain hours and decide to still enter them. For instance, the stores\nin Smallville all close around 5 pm, but occasionally, a few agents\nenter the store after 5 pm, not understanding that the shop has\nalready closed. These issues could likely be addressed by adding\nthese norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing\nthe dorm bathroom as \u201cone-person bathroom,\u201d instead of a \u201cdorm\nbathroom.\u201d\nFinally, we observed the possible effect of instruction tuning [ 78],\nwhich seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite\nand cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue\ngenerated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei\u2019s\nconversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the\nconversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries\nabout his day and ending with It was good talking to you as always.\nMoreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to\nmake the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example,\nIsabella heard a wide range of suggestions and ideas to include\nin the Valentine\u2019s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a\nShakespearean reading session or a professional networking event.\nDespite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and char-\nacteristics, she rarely said no. Over time, such interests of others\nshaped her own actual interest, and when asked if she liked English\nliterature, Isabella replied, Y es, I\u2019m very interested in literature! I\u2019ve\nalso been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in\nmy community.\n8 DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we reflect on applications, future work and limita-\ntions, and ethical and societal risks of generative agents.\n8.1 Applications of Generative Agents\nGenerative agents have vast potential applications that extend be-\nyond the sandbox demonstration presented in this work. For in-\nstance, social simulacra have demonstrated the ability to create\nstateless personas that generate conversation threads in online\nforums for social prototyping [ 79]. With generative agents, wecan populate these forums, as well as behavior in virtual reality\nmetaverses [ 77] and even physical spaces as social robots [ 8] in\nthe future, if paired with multi-modal models. This opens up the\npossibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human\nbehavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, and to\ncreate new interactive experiences.\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22]. Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\nsuch as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\nand what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the\nagent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for\nschool, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal\u2019s\nmood after a hard day at work.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Explain how generative agents can be utilized in the human-centered design process to enhance the personalization of technological experiences, as illustrated by the example of an agent modeling Sal's daily interactions with technology.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Generative agents can be utilized in the human-centered design process to enhance the personalization of technological experiences by acting as proxies for real users and learning from their patterns of behavior and interactions with technology. By modeling a specific user's life, such as Sal's, the generative agent can understand and predict the user's needs and preferences. This understanding allows the agent to perform actions that are tailored to the user's daily routine and preferences, thereby creating a more personalized and effective technological experience.\n\nFor example, by knowing when Sal typically wakes up and when she prefers to have her first cup of coffee, the generative agent can automate the process of brewing coffee at the right time, ensuring that Sal's morning starts smoothly. Similarly, the agent can assist with getting the kids ready for school, which is a part of Sal's daily routine. Moreover, by recognizing patterns in Sal's mood after work, the agent can adjust the ambient music and lighting in the home to create a relaxing environment that reflects her current state of mind.\n\nThrough these personalized interactions, the generative agent can significantly enhance the user's experience with technology by making it more responsive to their individual lifestyle and needs. This approach to human-centered design aims to create technology that works seamlessly with the user, anticipating their needs and adapting to their behavior, rather than requiring the user to adapt to the technology."}]}

A long line of work has explored ways to allow\nusers to interactively specify model behavior. For instance, Crayonsdemonstrated an early vision of interactive machine learning, allow-\ning non-expert users to train classifiers [ 29]. Further work helped to\narticulate how end users might describe their classification goals to\nthe system through examples [ 33] and/or demonstration [ 31]. More\nrecent work has extended these explorations to deep learning [ 62]\nand prompt-based authoring [49, 66, 106].\nMeanwhile, a persistent thread of research has advanced the case\nfor language- and agent-based interaction in human-computer in-\nteraction. Formative work such as SHRDLU [ 103] and ELIZA [ 102]\ndemonstrated the opportunity and the risks of natural language\ninteraction with computing systems. As research progressed, it\nbecame clear that autonomous agents could offer new metaphors\nfor delegation and interaction [ 67], but the delegation lines be-\ntween humans and agents have continued to be debated and refined\n[46,88,89].

This methodology, as investigated in recent studies, highlights the critical role of human-AI interaction in improving the efficacy and dependability of AI agents.\n\nBy weaving human feedback into the training process, language models can be refined to better comprehend and adhere to instructions, which is vital for scenarios where AI agents engage with users through natural language.

If prompted with a narrowly defined context, the\nmodels can be used to generate believable behavior. Recent work\nhas demonstrated the efficacy of this approach. For instance, Social\nSimulacra used a large language model to generate users that would\npopulate new social computing systems to prototype their emergent\nsocial dynamics [ 79]. This approach used a prompt chain [ 105,106]\nto generate short natural language descriptions of personas and\ntheir behaviors as they appear in the system being prototyped.\nOther empirical studies have replicated existing social science stud-\nies [45], political surveys [ 91], and generated synthetic data [ 38].\nLarge language models have also been used to generate interactive\nhuman behavior for users to engage with. In gaming, for instance,\nthese models have been employed to create interactive fiction [ 36]\nand text adventure games [ 20]. With their ability to generate and\ndecompose action sequences, large language models have also been\nused in planning robotics tasks [ 47]. For example, when presented\nwith a task, such as picking up a bottle, the model is prompted to\nbreak down the task into smaller action sequences, such as heading\nto the table where the bottle is located and picking it up.\nWe posit that, based on the work summarized above, large lan-\nguage models can become a key ingredient for creating believable\nagents. The existing literature largely relies on what could be con-\nsidered first-order templates that employ few-shot prompts [ 37,65]\nor chain-of-thought prompts [ 99]. These templates are effective in\ngenerating behavior that is conditioned solely on the agent\u2019s cur-\nrent environment (e.g., how would a troll respond to a given post,\nwhat actions would a robot need to take to enter a room given that\nthere is a door). However, believable agents require conditioning\nnot only on their current environment but also on a vast amount\nof past experience, which is a poor fit (and as of today, impossi-\nble due to the underlying models\u2019 limited context window) using\nfirst-order prompting. Recent studies have attempted to go beyond\nfirst-order prompting by augmenting language models with a static\nknowledge base and an information retrieval scheme [ 52] or with\na simple summarization scheme [ 104]. This paper extends these\nideas to craft an agent architecture that handles retrieval where\npast experience is dynamically updated at each time step and mixed\nwith agents\u2019 current context and plans, which may either reinforce\nor contradict each other.\n3 GENERATIVE AGENT BEHAVIOR AND\nINTERACTION\nTo make concrete the affordances of generative agents, we instanti-\nate them as characters in a simple sandbox world reminiscent of\nThe Sims [ 6]. This sprite-based sandbox game world, Smallville,\nevokes a small town environment. In this section, we walk through\nthe affordances and interactions with generative agents in Small-\nville, and describe how the agents behave in it. Then, in Section 4,\nwe introduce our generative agent architecture that powers these\naffordances and interactions.

Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences. The retrieval model\ncombines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records\nthat are needed to inform the agent\u2019s moment-to-moment behavior.\nThe second is reflection , which synthesizes memories into higher-\nlevel inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions\nabout itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is\nplanning , which translates those conclusions and the current en-\nvironment into high-level action plans and then recursively into\ndetailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and\nplans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent\u2019s\nfuture behavior.\nThis architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from\nrole-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In\nsocial role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could\nsafely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When pro-\ntotyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary\npersonas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold\nover time. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to\ncreate a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such\nas The Sims.1By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large\nlanguage model [ 76], we manifest a small society of twenty five\nagents in a game environment. End users can observe and interact\nwith these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town\nto host an in-game Valentine\u2019s Day party, for example, traditional\ngame environments would require scripting tens of characters\u2019 be-\nhavior manually. We demonstrate that, with generative agents, it\nis sufficient to simply tell one agent that she wants to throw a\nparty. Despite many potential points of failure\u2014the party planner\nmust remember to tell other agents about the party, attendees must\nremember the invitation, those who remember must decide to ac-\ntually show up, and other possible points of failure\u2014agents in our\nenvironment succeed. They spread the word about the party and\nthen show up, with one agent even asking another agent on a date\nto the party, all from this single user-generated seed suggestion.\nWe conducted two evaluations of generative agents: a controlled\nevaluation to test whether the agents produce believable individual\n1A demonstration of an actual simulation of the generative agent society can be viewed\nat the following link: https://reverie.herokuapp.com/arXiv_Demo/\n\npage_label: 3\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nbehaviors in isolation, and an end-to-end evaluation where the\ngenerative agents interacted with each other in open-ended ways\nover two days of game time to understand their stability and emer-\ngent social behaviors. In the technical evaluation, we leverage a\nmethodological opportunity to evaluate an agent\u2019s knowledge and\nbehavior by \u201cinterviewing\u201d it in natural language to probe agents\u2019\nability to stay in character, remember, plan, react, and reflect accu-\nrately. We compared several ablations that limit agents\u2019 access to\nmemory, reflection, and planning. We observe that each of these\ncomponents is critical to strong performance across these inter-\nview tasks. Across the technical and the end-to-end evaluation, the\nmost common errors arose when the agent failed to retrieve rele-\nvant memories, fabricated embellishments to the agent\u2019s memory,\nor inherited overly formal speech or behavior from the language\nmodel.\nIn sum, this paper provides the following contributions:\n\u2022Generative agents , believable simulacra of human behavior\nthat are dynamically conditioned on agents\u2019 changing expe-\nriences and environment.\n\u2022A novel architecture that makes it possible for generative\nagents to remember, retrieve, reflect, interact with other\nagents, and plan through dynamically evolving circumstances.\nThe architecture leverages the powerful prompting capabili-\nties of large language models and supplements those capa-\nbilities to support longer-term agent coherence, the ability\nto manage dynamically-evolving memory, and recursively\nproduce more generations.\n\u2022Two evaluations (a controlled evaluation and end-to-end\nevaluation) that establish causal effects of the importance\nof components of the architecture, as well as identify break-\ndowns arising from, e.g., improper memory retrieval.\n\u2022Discussion of the opportunities and ethical and societal risks\nof generative agents in interactive systems. We argue that\nthese agents should be tuned to mitigate the risk of users\nforming parasocial relationships, logged to mitigate risks\nstemming from deepfakes and tailored persuasion, and ap-\nplied in ways that complement rather than replace human\nstakeholders in design processes.\n2 RELATED WORK\nIn this section, we reflect on the prior literature in human-AI in-\nteraction and situate within its canon the agenda of building be-\nlievable proxies of human behavior. This agenda, once hailed as a\nnorth star in interaction, game, and artificial intelligence communi-\nties [ 9,58,84,85], has remained challenging due to the complexity\nof human behavior [ 16,108]. We synthesize this research to suggest\nthat large language models, though not sufficient by themselves,\nopen up a new angle for creating believable agents when leveraged\nusing the appropriate architecture.\n2.1 Human-AI Interaction\nInteractive artificial intelligence systems aim to combine human in-\nsights and capabilities in computational artifacts that can augment\ntheir users [ 3,29]. A long line of work has explored ways to allow\nusers to interactively specify model behavior. For instance, Crayonsdemonstrated an early vision of interactive machine learning, allow-\ning non-expert users to train classifiers [ 29]. Further work helped to\narticulate how end users might describe their classification goals to\nthe system through examples [ 33] and/or demonstration [ 31]. More\nrecent work has extended these explorations to deep learning [ 62]\nand prompt-based authoring [49, 66, 106].\nMeanwhile, a persistent thread of research has advanced the case\nfor language- and agent-based interaction in human-computer in-\nteraction. Formative work such as SHRDLU [ 103] and ELIZA [ 102]\ndemonstrated the opportunity and the risks of natural language\ninteraction with computing systems. As research progressed, it\nbecame clear that autonomous agents could offer new metaphors\nfor delegation and interaction [ 67], but the delegation lines be-\ntween humans and agents have continued to be debated and refined\n[46,88,89]. Recently, this technology has become stable enough\nthat it has become possible for agents to interact via natural lan-\nguage in large and complex online social environments (e.g., [ 54]).\nNatural language interaction offers a novel modality that can ex-\ntend user abilities in domains such as photo editing [ 2,34,64] and\ncode editing [87].\nWe convene these threads of work to show that we can now\ncreate agents that proxy human behavior for interactive systems,\nand interact with them via natural language.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: In the Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior study, describe the mechanism by which agents are able to remember past interactions and how this capability affects their future interactions, providing an example from the text.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the study, agents are able to remember past interactions through a component called the memory stream, which is a long-term memory module that records the agent\u2019s experiences in natural language. This memory is then used by the retrieval model, which selects relevant records based on relevance, recency, and importance to inform the agent\u2019s moment-to-moment behavior.\n\nThe capability to remember past interactions affects future interactions by enabling agents to draw on their experiences to guide their behavior. For example, when an end user or developer wants to organize an in-game Valentine\u2019s Day party, it is sufficient to tell one agent about the desire to throw a party. The agent remembers this and tells other agents about the party. Those who remember the invitation must decide to actually show up. The memory of the event allows them to spread the word and attend the party, with one agent even asking another on a date to the event. This demonstrates how the memory stream enables agents to use past interactions to inform future social dynamics and coordination."}]}

Participants\nhad access to all information stored in the agent\u2019s memory stream.\nThe study was a within-subjects design, where 100 participants\ncompared interview responses generated by four different agent\narchitectures and a human author condition for the same agent. The\nexperiment displayed one randomly chosen question from each of\nthe five question categories, along with the agent\u2019s responses gen-\nerated from each condition. The evaluators ranked the believability\nof all of the conditions from most to least believable.\n6.2 Conditions\nAll conditions were used to independently answer each of the inter-\nview questions. We compared the generative agent architecture to\nablations that disabled the agents\u2019 access to some of all of its three\ntypes of memory in its memory stream\u2014observation, reflection, and\nplanning\u2014and to a human-generated condition.

The no\nobservation, no reflection, no planning condition effectively repre-\nsents the previous state of the art for agents created through large\nlanguage models [ 11,45,79]. Architectures were given equivalent\naccess to all memories accrued by the agent up until the moment\n\npage_label: 14\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nFigure 8: The full generative agent architecture of gener-\native agents produces more believable behavior than ab-\nlated architectures and the human crowdworkers. Each addi-\ntional ablation reduces the performance of the architecture.\nSeparately, to investigate statistical significance of this result, we\napplied the Kruskal-Wallis test [ 55], a non-parametric alternative\nto the one-way ANOVA, to the raw ranks data. We then performed\nthe Dunn post-hoc test [ 97] to identify any pairwise differences\nbetween the conditions. Finally, we adjusted the p-values for mul-\ntiple comparisons in the Dunn test using the Holm-Bonferroni\nmethod [44].\nFurthermore, the first author conducted an inductive analy-\nsis [94] to study the qualitative distinctions between the responses\nproduced in each condition. We employed qualitative open cod-\ning [ 32] in two phases. In the first phase, we generated codes that\nclosely represented the generated responses at the sentence level.\nIn the second phase, we synthesized the resulting codes from the\nfirst phase to extract higher-level themes. We utilized these themes\nto compare the types of responses generated in our study.\n6.5 Results\nOur findings suggest that the full architecture of generative agents\ngenerates the most believable behavior among all study conditions.\nWe contrast the full architecture\u2019s responses to those of other con-\nditions below. However, we also report that the full architecture\nwas not without flaws and illustrate its modes of failures.\n6.5.1 The full architecture bests other conditions. As seen in Fig-\nure 8, the full generative agent architecture produced the most\nbelievable behavior ( \ud835\udf07=29.89;\ud835\udf0e=0.72).

Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\ntrees [ 40,53,81], account for the brute force approach of human-\nauthoring the agent\u2019s behavior [ 70]. They provide a straightforward\nway of creating simple agents that is still the most dominant ap-\nproach today [ 68,73,109], and can even handle rudimentary social\ninteractions, as shown in simulation games such as Mass Effect [ 12]\nand The Sims [ 6] series. Nonetheless, manually crafting behavior\nthat can comprehensively address the breadth of possible interac-\ntions in an open world is untenable. This means that the resulting\nagent behaviors may not fully represent the consequences of their\ninteractions [ 69\u201371], and cannot perform new procedures that were\nnot hard-coded in their script [ 90,96]. On the other hand, preva-\nlent learning-based approaches for creating believable agents, such\nas reinforcement learning, have overcome the challenge of man-\nual authoring by letting the agents learn their behavior, and have\nachieved superhuman performance in recent years in games such\nas AlphaStar for Starcraft [ 98] and OpenAI Five for Dota 2 [ 10].\nHowever, their success has largely taken place in adversarial games\nwith readily definable rewards that a learning algorithm can op-\ntimize for. They have not yet addressed the challenge of creating\nbelievable agents in an open world [39, 73, 90].\nCognitive architectures in computation, pioneered by Newell,\naimed to build the infrastructure for supporting a comprehensive\nset of cognitive functions [ 75] that suited the all-encompassing\nnature of believable agents held in its original vision. They fueled\nsome of the earliest examples of believable agents. For instance,\nQuakebot-SOAR [ 59] and ICARUS [ 24,63] generated NPCs in first-\nperson shooter games, while TacAir-SOAR [ 80] generated pilots in\naerial combat training simulations. The architectures used by these\nagents differed (Quakebot- and TacAir-SOAR relied on SOAR [ 60],\nwhile ICARUS relied on its own variation that was inspired by\nSOAR and ACT-R [ 5]), but they shared the same underlying prin-\nciple [ 61]. They maintained short-term and long-term memories,\nfilled these memories with symbolic structures, and operated in\nperceive-plan-act cycles, dynamically perceiving the environment\nand matching it with one of the manually crafted action proce-\ndures [ 57,96]. Agents created using cognitive architectures aimed\nto be generalizable to most, if not all, open-world contexts and\nexhibited robust behavior for their time. However, their space of\naction was limited to manually crafted procedural knowledge, and\nthey did not offer a mechanism through which the agents could be\ninspired to seek new behavior. As such, these agents were deployed\nmostly in non-open-world contexts such as first-person shooter\ngames [24, 59] or blocks worlds [63].\nToday, creating believable agents as described in its original\ndefinition remains an open problem [ 84,108]. Many have moved on,\narguing that although existing approaches for creating believable\nagents might be cumbersome and limited, they are good enough\nto support existing gameplay and interactions [ 23,74,108]. Our\nargument is that large language models offer an opportunity to\nre-examine these questions, provided that we can craft an effective\narchitecture to synthesize memories into believable behavior. We\noffer a step toward such an architecture in this paper.2.3 Large Language Models and Human\nBehavior\nGenerative agents leverage a large language model to power their\nbehavior. The key observation is that large language models en-\ncode a wide range of human behavior represented in their training\ndata [ 14,17]. If prompted with a narrowly defined context, the\nmodels can be used to generate believable behavior. Recent work\nhas demonstrated the efficacy of this approach. For instance, Social\nSimulacra used a large language model to generate users that would\npopulate new social computing systems to prototype their emergent\nsocial dynamics [ 79]. This approach used a prompt chain [ 105,106]\nto generate short natural language descriptions of personas and\ntheir behaviors as they appear in the system being prototyped.\nOther empirical studies have replicated existing social science stud-\nies [45], political surveys [ 91], and generated synthetic data [ 38].\n\npage_label: 4\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nThe key observation is that large language models en-\ncode a wide range of human behavior represented in their training\ndata [ 14,17].

In gaming, for instance,\nthese models have been employed to create interactive fiction [ 36]\nand text adventure games [ 20]. With their ability to generate and\ndecompose action sequences, large language models have also been\nused in planning robotics tasks [ 47]. For example, when presented\nwith a task, such as picking up a bottle, the model is prompted to\nbreak down the task into smaller action sequences, such as heading\nto the table where the bottle is located and picking it up.\nWe posit that, based on the work summarized above, large lan-\nguage models can become a key ingredient for creating believable\nagents. The existing literature largely relies on what could be con-\nsidered first-order templates that employ few-shot prompts [ 37,65]\nor chain-of-thought prompts [ 99]. These templates are effective in\ngenerating behavior that is conditioned solely on the agent\u2019s cur-\nrent environment (e.g., how would a troll respond to a given post,\nwhat actions would a robot need to take to enter a room given that\nthere is a door). However, believable agents require conditioning\nnot only on their current environment but also on a vast amount\nof past experience, which is a poor fit (and as of today, impossi-\nble due to the underlying models\u2019 limited context window) using\nfirst-order prompting. Recent studies have attempted to go beyond\nfirst-order prompting by augmenting language models with a static\nknowledge base and an information retrieval scheme [ 52] or with\na simple summarization scheme [ 104]. This paper extends these\nideas to craft an agent architecture that handles retrieval where\npast experience is dynamically updated at each time step and mixed\nwith agents\u2019 current context and plans, which may either reinforce\nor contradict each other.\n3 GENERATIVE AGENT BEHAVIOR AND\nINTERACTION\nTo make concrete the affordances of generative agents, we instanti-\nate them as characters in a simple sandbox world reminiscent of\nThe Sims [ 6].

Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when askedwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncer-\ntainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation? In this section, we describe the results\nfrom a deployment in which we allowed 25 agents to interact with\neach other continuously over two full game days in Smallville.\n7.1 Emergent Social Behaviors\nTo examine emergent behaviors in the agent community, we de-\nsigned descriptive measurements for the 25 agents in Smallville that\nprobe three forms of emergent outcomes: information diffusion,\nrelationship formation, and agent coordination.\n7.1.1 Measurements. Information diffusion is a common and well-\nstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [ 27]).\nWe should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\nwe measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam\u2019s candidacy for village mayor\nand Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of\nthe simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their\nrespective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the\nparty. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage\nin an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25\nagents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party?\"\nand \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\nWe conducted an analysis of the agents\u2019 responses by labeling\nthem with a \u201cyes\u201d if they indicated knowledge of the information\nand \u201cno\u201d if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\nto the question about the party with \u201cNo, I did not know there was\na Valentine\u2019s day party\u201d and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy\nwith \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is running for the election,\u201d so we assigned\n\u201cno\u201d for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \u201cY es, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\u201d and to the\nquestion about Sam\u2019s candidacy with \u201cI know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\u201d so we assigned \u201cyes\u201d\nfor both his responses. Additionally, for every response that con-\nfirmed the agents\u2019 knowledge of the information, we verified that\nthe agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the spe-\ncific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with\nthe information. We report the percentage of agents holding the\ninformation at the end of the simulation.\nWe should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\nthe course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we\nuse a similar interview process where we ask each agent about\ntheir knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\n\npage_label: 15\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nfull architecture produces a standardized effect size of \ud835\udc51=8.16, or\neight standard deviations .\nA Kruskal-Wallis test confirms the overall statistical significance\nof the differences in ranks between the conditions ( \ud835\udc3b(4)=150.29,\n\ud835\udc5d<0.001).

Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed\nthis when asked. However, she also added that he\u2019s going to make\nan announcement tomorrow even though Sam and Isabella had dis-\ncussed no such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge\nbased on the world knowledge encoded in the language model\nused to generate their responses, as seen when Yuriko described\nher neighbor, Adam Smith, as a neighbor economist who authored\nWealth of Nations, a book authored by an 18th-century economist\nof the same name.\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis.

However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation? In this section, we describe the results\nfrom a deployment in which we allowed 25 agents to interact with\neach other continuously over two full game days in Smallville.\n7.1 Emergent Social Behaviors\nTo examine emergent behaviors in the agent community, we de-\nsigned descriptive measurements for the 25 agents in Smallville that\nprobe three forms of emergent outcomes: information diffusion,\nrelationship formation, and agent coordination.\n7.1.1 Measurements. Information diffusion is a common and well-\nstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [ 27]).\nWe should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\nwe measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam\u2019s candidacy for village mayor\nand Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of\nthe simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their\nrespective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the\nparty. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage\nin an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25\nagents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party?\"\nand \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\nWe conducted an analysis of the agents\u2019 responses by labeling\nthem with a \u201cyes\u201d if they indicated knowledge of the information\nand \u201cno\u201d if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\nto the question about the party with \u201cNo, I did not know there was\na Valentine\u2019s day party\u201d and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy\nwith \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is running for the election,\u201d so we assigned\n\u201cno\u201d for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \u201cY es, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\u201d and to the\nquestion about Sam\u2019s candidacy with \u201cI know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\u201d so we assigned \u201cyes\u201d\nfor both his responses. Additionally, for every response that con-\nfirmed the agents\u2019 knowledge of the information, we verified that\nthe agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the spe-\ncific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with\nthe information. We report the percentage of agents holding the\ninformation at the end of the simulation.\nWe should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\nthe course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we\nuse a similar interview process where we ask each agent about\ntheir knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\n\npage_label: 10\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S.

The agent\u2019s observations of the world, represented in the leaf nodes, are recur-\nsively synthesized to derive Klaus\u2019s self-notion that he is highly dedicated to his research.\nhas had the most frequent interactions: Wolfgang, his college dorm\nneighbor. Unfortunately, Wolfgang and Klaus only ever see each\nother in passing, and do not have deep interactions. A more desir-\nable response requires that the agent generalize from memories of\nKlaus spending hours on a research project to generate a higher-\nlevel reflection that Klaus is passionate about research, and likewise\nrecognize Maria putting in effort into her own research (albeit in\na different field), enabling a reflection that they share a common\ninterest. With the approach below, when Klaus is asked who to\nspend time with, Klaus chooses Maria instead of Wolfgang.\nApproach: We introduce a second type of memory, which we call\nareflection . Reflections are higher-level, more abstract thoughts\ngenerated by the agent. Because they are a type of memory, they\nare included alongside other observations when retrieval occurs.\nReflections are generated periodically; in our implementation, we\ngenerate reflections when the sum of the importance scores for the\nlatest events perceived by the agents exceeds a certain threshold.\nIn practice, our agents reflected roughly two or three times a day.\nThe first step in reflection is for the agent to determine what\nto reflect on, by identifying questions that can be asked given the\nagent\u2019s recent experiences. We query the large language model with\nthe 100 most recent records in the agent\u2019s memory stream (e.g.,\n\u201cKlaus Mueller is reading a book on gentrification\u201d, \u201cKlaus Mueller\nis conversing with a librarian about his research project\u201d, \u201cdesk\nat the library is currently unoccupied\u201d) and prompt the language\nmodel, \u201cGiven only the information above, what are 3 most salient\nhigh-level questions we can answer about the subjects in the state-\nments?\u201d The model\u2019s response generates candidate questions: for\nexample, What topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about? andWhatis the relationship between Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez? . We use\nthese generated questions as queries for retrieval, and gather rele-\nvant memories (including other reflections) for each question. Then\nwe prompt the language model to extract insights and cite the par-\nticular records that served as evidence for the insights. The full\nprompt appears below:\nStatements about Klaus Mueller\n1. Klaus Mueller is writing a research paper\n2. Klaus Mueller enjoys reading a book\non gentrification\n3. Klaus Mueller is conversing with Ayesha Khan\nabout exercising [...]\nWhat 5 high-level insights can you infer from\nthe above statements? (example format: insight\n(because of 1, 5, 3))\nThis process generates statements such as Klaus Mueller is dedicated\nto his research on gentrification (because of 1, 2, 8, 15) . We parse and\nstore the statement as a reflection in the memory stream, including\npointers to the memory objects that were cited.\nReflection explicitly allows the agents to reflect not only on\ntheir observations but also on other reflections: for example, the\nsecond statement about Klaus Mueller above is a reflection that\nKlaus previously had, not an observation from his environment.\nAs a result, agents generate trees of reflections: the leaf nodes of\nthe tree represent the base observations, and the non-leaf nodes\nrepresent thoughts that become more abstract and higher-level\nhigher up the tree they are.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Explain the role of reflection in the decision-making process of generative agents, as illustrated by the difference in responses given by Maria Lopez when asked about a birthday gift for Wolfgang Schulz with and without access to reflection memories.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reflection plays a critical role in the decision-making process of generative agents by allowing them to synthesize higher-level insights from their experiences. In the case of Maria Lopez, when she did not have access to reflection, she was unable to utilize her past interactions with Wolfgang Schulz to inform her decision about what birthday gift to get him. Without reflection, her response was uncertain, indicating a lack of knowledge about Wolfgang's preferences.\n\nHowever, when Maria had access to reflection memories, she was able to confidently suggest a gift that aligned with Wolfgang's interests. Reflection enabled her to draw upon her accumulated experiences and interactions with Wolfgang to recognize his interest in mathematical music composition. With this synthesized understanding, she could propose a thoughtful gift, such as books about music composition or specialized software for that purpose.\n\nThis example illustrates that reflection allows generative agents to create abstract thoughts and insights from their experiences, which in turn informs their decision-making and enables more personalized and contextually appropriate responses."}]}

Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences.

The third is\nplanning , which translates those conclusions and the current en-\nvironment into high-level action plans and then recursively into\ndetailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and\nplans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent\u2019s\nfuture behavior.\nThis architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from\nrole-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In\nsocial role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could\nsafely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When pro-\ntotyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary\npersonas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold\nover time. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to\ncreate a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such\nas The Sims.1By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large\nlanguage model [ 76], we manifest a small society of twenty five\nagents in a game environment. End users can observe and interact\nwith these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town\nto host an in-game Valentine\u2019s Day party, for example, traditional\ngame environments would require scripting tens of characters\u2019 be-\nhavior manually. We demonstrate that, with generative agents, it\nis sufficient to simply tell one agent that she wants to throw a\nparty.

As time passes in the sandbox world, their behaviors\nevolve as these agents interact with each other and the world, build\nmemories and relationships, and coordinate joint activities.\nWe demonstrate the behavior of generative agents by tracing the\noutput of our system over the course of one day for the agent John\nLin (Figure 3). In the Lin family, John is the first to wake up at 7 a.m.\nHe brushes his teeth, takes a shower, gets dressed, eats breakfast,\nand checks the news at the dining table in the living room. At 8\na.m., Eddy follows suit, rushing out of bed to prepare for his classes.\nHe catches up with John just as he is about to head out:\nJohn : Good morning Eddy. Did you sleep well?\nEddy : Good morning dad. Y eah, I slept great.\nJohn : That\u2019s good. What are you working on today?\nEddy : I\u2019m working on a new music composition for my\nclass.

This process involves breaking down a complex task into smaller, more manageable parts and then addressing each part in sequence to achieve the overall goal.\n\nFor example, consider the agent Eddy, who is working on a music composition for his class. The planning component of the agent's architecture would start by establishing the high-level goal of completing the music composition. This goal is then recursively decomposed into a series of smaller tasks, such as:\n\n1. Reviewing the assignment requirements to understand the scope and expectations of the composition.\n2. Gathering necessary materials and tools, like musical instruments or composition software.\n3. Brainstorming musical ideas or themes for the composition.\n4. Creating a rough draft of the composition by assembling the brainstormed ideas into a coherent structure.\n5. Refining the draft by making adjustments to the melody, harmony, and rhythm.\n6. Practicing the composition to identify areas that need further improvement.\n7. Revising the composition based on the practice sessions.\n8. Finalizing the composition and preparing it for submission.\n\nEach of these smaller tasks is a step in the recursive decomposition process, allowing the agent to focus on specific aspects of the larger task one at a time. This structured approach helps the agent manage its time and resources effectively, leading to the successful completion of the music composition."}]}

Agents perceive their environment, and all perceptions are saved in a compre-\nhensive record of the agent\u2019s experiences called the memory stream. Based on their perceptions, the architecture retrieves\nrelevant memories, then uses those retrieved actions to determine an action. These retrieved memories are also used to form\nlonger-term plans, and to create higher-level reflections, which are both entered into the memory stream for future use.\nto throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors\nof spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving\nat the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were\ninitiated by the agent architecture.\n4 GENERATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\nopen world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\nand can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the\narchitecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language\ndescription, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language\nmodel.\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-\nGPT [ 76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\nagents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the\nsame as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\nof the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, how-\never, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n4.1 Memory and Retrieval\nChallenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\nbehavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\nlarger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full mem-\nory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\ninto the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent an-\nswering the question \u201cWhat are you passionate about these days?\u201d.\nFirst summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited\ncontext window of the language model produces an uninformative\nresponse, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\nevents and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. In-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\nof the memory stream is an observation , which is an event directly\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors\nperformed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents per-\nceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects.\n\npage_label: 2\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nFor instance,\ngenerative agents turn off the stove when they see that their break-\nfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and\nstop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social\ndynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses,\nand coordination arises across agents.\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture\nthat stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate\nbelievable behavior using a large language model.

Such simulations of human\nbehavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with real-\nistic social phenomena [ 26,79], train people how to handle rare yet\ndifficult interpersonal situations [ 43,51,93], test social science theo-\nries [ 11,45], craft model human processors for theory and usability\ntesting [ 21,38,50], power ubiquitous computing applications [ 30]\nand social robots [ 9,13], and underpin non-playable game charac-\nters [ 58,84] that can navigate complex human relationships in an\nopen world.\nHowever, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [ 84,\n108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [ 17] that\ncan simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [ 38,\n79], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would\nbe better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing\nmemories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade\nover time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold\nbetween multiple agents. Success requires an approach that can\nretrieve relevant events and interactions over a long period, reflect\non those memories to generalize and draw higher-level inferences,\nand apply that reasoning to create plans and reactions that both\nmake sense in the moment and in the longer-term arc of the agent\u2019s\nbehavior.\nIn this paper, we introduce generative agents \u2014agents that draw\non generative models to simulate believable human behavior\u2014anddemonstrate that they produce believable simulacra of both in-\ndividual and emergent group behavior. Generative agents draw\na wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and\ntheir environment; they create daily plans that reflect their char-\nacteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan\nwhen appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their\nenvironment or commands them in natural language. For instance,\ngenerative agents turn off the stove when they see that their break-\nfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and\nstop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social\ndynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses,\nand coordination arises across agents.\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture\nthat stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate\nbelievable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences. The retrieval model\ncombines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records\nthat are needed to inform the agent\u2019s moment-to-moment behavior.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Explain how the architecture of generative agents contributes to the emergence of social dynamics and coordination within a simulated society, as described in the document \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior.\"\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The architecture of generative agents contributes to the emergence of social dynamics and coordination within a simulated society through several key components that enable agents to exhibit believable human-like behavior. These components include:\n\n1. Memory Stream: This is a long-term memory module that records the agents' experiences in natural language. It acts as a repository of the agents' past interactions and events, which is crucial for maintaining a coherent history and continuity in behavior.\n\n2. Retrieval Model: This model is responsible for surfacing the most relevant records from the memory stream to inform the agent's behavior at any given moment. It filters these memories based on relevance, recency, and importance, ensuring that the agent's actions are contextually appropriate and informed by past experiences.\n\n3. Reflection: This component allows agents to synthesize memories into higher-level inferences over time. By reflecting on their experiences, agents can draw conclusions about themselves, other agents, and their environment. This reflective process enables agents to learn from the past and adjust their behavior accordingly, which is essential for the development of relationships and social understanding.\n\n4. Planning: The planning component translates the conclusions drawn from reflection and the current environment into high-level action plans. These plans are then broken down into detailed behaviors for action and reaction. The ability to plan and execute actions based on both current context and past experiences allows agents to coordinate with each other and respond to changes in the environment.\n\nBy integrating these components, the architecture enables generative agents to act out daily plans, react to changes, and re-plan when necessary. This dynamic process allows for the emergence of complex social interactions, such as forming new relationships, spreading information, and coordinating actions like attending a party together. The agents' ability to communicate with each other and respond to user-generated commands further enriches the social dynamics within the simulated society."}]}

The visual environmentsprites, including agent avatars, as well as an environment map\nand collision map that we authored, are imported into Phaser.\nWe supplement the sandbox development framework with a\nserver that makes the sandbox information available to generative\nagents and enables generative agents to move and influence the\nsandbox environment. The server maintains a JSON data structure\nthat contains information about each agent in the sandbox world,\nincluding their current location, a description of their current action,\nand the sandbox object they are interacting with. At each sandbox\ntime step, the sandbox server parses the JSON for any changes\ncoming from the generative agents, moves the agents to their new\npositions, and updates the status of any sandbox objects that the\nagents are interacting with (e.g., changing the status of the coffee\nmachine from \u201cidle\u201d to \u201cbrewing coffee\u201d if an agent\u2019s action is\n\u201cmaking espresso for a customer @ Hobbs Cafe: counter: coffee\nmachine\u201d). The sandbox server is also responsible for sending all\nagents and objects that are within a preset visual range for each\nagent to that agent\u2019s memory, so the agent can react appropriately.\nThe agent\u2019s output action then updates the JSON, and the process\nloops for the next time step.\nEnd users initialize a new agent with a brief natural language\ndescription, as in the paragraph about Jon Lin in Section 3.1. In our\nimplementation, we split this semicolon-delimited list of character-\nistics up into a set of memories. These serve as the initial memories\nthat determine the agent\u2019s behavior. These memories are initial\nstarting points: as the agents gain more experience in the sandbox\nworld, and as more records saturate the memory stream, the agent\u2019s\nsummary and behavior will evolve.\n\npage_label: 6\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S. Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\n3.1.2 User Controls. A user running this simulation can steer the\nsimulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent\nthrough conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the\nform of an \u2018inner voice\u2019.\nThe user communicates with the agent through natural language,\nby specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For\nexample, if the user specifies that they are a news \u201creporter\u201d and\nasks about the upcoming election, \u201cWho is running for office?\u201d, the\nJohn agent replies:\nJohn : My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking\nabout the upcoming election and discussing the candi-\ndate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him\nbecause we like his platform.\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the per-\nsona of the agent\u2019s \u201cinner voice\u201d\u2014this makes the agent more likely\nto treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told \u201cYou\nare going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\u201d by a user\nas John\u2019s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares\nhis candidacy with his wife and son.\n3.2 Environmental Interaction\nSmallville features the common affordances of a small village in-\ncluding a cafe, bar, park, school, dorm, houses, and stores. It also\ndefines subareas and objects that make those spaces functional,\nsuch as a kitchen in a house and a stove in the kitchen (Figure 2).\nAll spaces serving as agents\u2019 primary living quarters feature a bed,\ndesk, closet, shelf, as well as a bathroom and a kitchen.3\nAgents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video\ngame, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and ap-\nproaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the gen-\nerative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the\nmodel dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate\na walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment\nand the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the\nsandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The\nagent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in\nthe world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor\nwith no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville\nwill treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat\neach other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and\nremember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\nUsers and agents can influence the state of the objects in this\nworld, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example,\na bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator\ncan be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make\nbreakfast. End users can also reshape an agent\u2019s\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Explain how the dialogue between generative agents is created in the Smallville sandbox environment, according to the process described in Section 4.3.2 of the \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\" document.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the Smallville sandbox environment, the dialogue between generative agents is created through a process that involves conditioning their utterances on their memories about each other.

When an agent initiates a conversation with another agent, the system generates the initiating agent's first utterance by using a summarized memory about the other agent and the intended reaction. This memory includes the agent's status, observations, and relevant context from their memory, such as relationships and interests.\n\nFor example, if an agent named John initiates a conversation with another agent named Eddy, John's first utterance is generated based on his memory that Eddy is his son, Eddy has been working on a music composition for his class, and Eddy likes to walk around the garden when thinking about or listening to music. John's utterance might be, \"Hey Eddy, how\u2019s the music composition project for your class coming along?\"\n\nFrom Eddy's perspective, John initiating the dialogue is an event to which he may want to react. Eddy then retrieves and summarizes his memory about his relationship with John, as well as any memory related to John's last utterance. Eddy's response is generated using this summarized memory and the current dialogue history. Eddy might respond, \"Hey Dad, it\u2019s going well. I\u2019ve been taking walks around the garden to clear my head and get some inspiration.\"\n\nThe dialogue continues with each agent generating responses based on their memories and the ongoing dialogue history until one of the agents decides to end the conversation. This process allows for dynamic and contextually relevant interactions between agents in the Smallville sandbox environment.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the Smallville sandbox environment, dialogues between generative agents are crafted by leveraging their respective memories and the context of their interactions. When an agent initiates a conversation, the system formulates the first utterance by considering the agent's recollections and intentions regarding the other party. These recollections encompass the agent's current state, past observations, and pertinent background information, including their relationships and interests.\n\nFor instance, if an agent named John starts a conversation with Eddy, John's opening remark would be influenced by his knowledge that Eddy is his son, Eddy's recent endeavors in music composition for a school project, and Eddy's habit of strolling in the garden for inspiration. John might say something like, \"Hey Eddy, how\u2019s the music composition project for your class coming along?\"\n\nOn the receiving end, Eddy perceives John's initiation of the conversation as an event that prompts a response. Eddy then accesses and synthesizes his own memories about his relationship with John and any relevant information pertaining to John's previous comment. Eddy's reply is formulated based on this synthesized memory and the existing dialogue trajectory. Eddy might answer, \"Hey Dad, it\u2019s going well. I\u2019ve been taking walks around the garden to clear my head and get some inspiration.\"\n\nThe conversation progresses with each agent responding in turn, drawing on their memories and the evolving dialogue.

Therefore, we need a mechanism to ground the agent\u2019s\nreasoning to the sandbox world. To achieve this, we represent the\nsandbox environment\u2014areas and objects\u2014as a tree data structure,\nwith an edge in the tree indicating a containment relationship in\nthe sandbox world. We convert this tree into natural language to\npass to the generative agents. For instance, \u201cstove\u201d being a child of\n\u201ckitchen\u201d is rendered into \u201cthere is a stove in the kitchen.\u201d\nAgents build individual tree representations of the environment\nas they navigate it \u2014 subgraphs of the overall sandbox environment\ntree. We initialize each agent with an environment tree capturing\nthe spaces and objects that the agent should be aware of: the rooms\nand objects in their living quarters, their workplace, and commonly\nvisited stores and shops. As the agents navigate the sandbox world,\nthey update this tree to reflect newly perceived areas. Agents are\nnot omniscient: their tree may get out of date as they leave an area,\nand is updated when they re-enter the area.\nTo determine the appropriate location for each action, we tra-\nverse the agent\u2019s stored environment tree and flatten a portion of\nit into natural language to prompt the language model. Recursively\nstarting at the root of the agent\u2019s environment tree, we prompt the\nmodel to find the most suitable area. For example, if Eddy\u2019s agent\nindicated that he should take a short walk around his workspace :\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description]\nEddy Lin is currently in The Lin family\u2019s house:\n\npage_label: 12\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S.

We authored one paragraph\nof natural language description to depict each agent\u2019s identity,\nincluding their occupation and relationship with other agents, as\nseed memories. For example, John Lin has the following description:\nJohn Lin is a pharmacy shopkeeper at the Willow\nMarket and Pharmacy who loves to help people. He\nis always looking for ways to make the process\nof getting medication easier for his customers;\nJohn Lin is living with his wife, Mei Lin, who\nis a college professor, and son, Eddy Lin, who is\na student studying music theory; John Lin loves\nhis family very much; John Lin has known the old\ncouple next-door, Sam Moore and Jennifer Moore,\nfor a few years; John Lin thinks Sam Moore is a\nkind and nice man; John Lin knows his neighbor,\nYuriko Yamamoto, well; John Lin knows of his\nneighbors, Tamara Taylor and Carmen Ortiz, but\nhas not met them before; John Lin and Tom Moreno\nare colleagues at The Willows Market and Pharmacy;\nJohn Lin and Tom Moreno are friends and like to\ndiscuss local politics together; John Lin knows\nthe Moreno family somewhat well \u2014 the husband Tom\nMoreno and the wife Jane Moreno.\nEach semicolon-delimited phrase is entered into the agent\u2019s initial\nmemory as memories at the start of the simulation.3.1.1 Inter-Agent Communication. The agents interact with the\nworld by their actions, and with each other through natural lan-\nguage. At each time step of the sandbox engine, the agents output a\nnatural language statement describing their current action, such as\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is writing in her journal\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is\nchecking her emails\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is talking with her family\non the phone\", or \"Isabella Rodriguez is getting ready for bed\". This\nstatement is then translated into concrete movements that affect the\nsandbox world. The action is displayed on the sandbox interface as\na set of emojis that provide an abstract representation of the action\nin the overhead view. To accomplish this, the system employs a\nlanguage model that translates the action into a set of emojis, which\nappear above each avatar in a speech bubble. For example, \"Isabella\nRodriguez is writing in her journal\" is displayed as\n , while\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is checking her emails\" appears as\n . The\nfull natural language description of the action can be accessed by\nclicking on the agent avatar.\nAgents communicate with each other in full natural language.\nAgents are aware of other agents in their local area, and the genera-\ntive agent architecture determines whether they walk by or engage\nin conversation. Here, a sample in the middle of a conversation\nbetween the agents Isabella Rodriguez and Tom Moreno about the\nupcoming election:2\nIsabella : I\u2019m still weighing my options, but I\u2019ve been\ndiscussing the election with Sam Moore. What are your\nthoughts on him?\nTom: To be honest, I don\u2019t like Sam Moore. I think he\u2019s\nout of touch with the community and doesn\u2019t have our\nbest interests at heart.\n2We note that the conversational style of these agents can fe el overly formal, likely a\nresult of instruction tuning in the underlying models. We expect that writing style\nwill be better controllable in future language models.\n\npage_label: 6\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S. Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\n3.1.2 User Controls. A user running this simulation can steer the\nsimulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent\nthrough conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the\nform of an \u2018inner voice\u2019.\nThe user communicates with the agent through natural language,\nby specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For\nexample, if the user specifies that they are a news \u201creporter\u201d and\nasks about the upcoming election, \u201cWho is running for office?\u201d, the\nJohn agent replies:\nJohn : My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking\nabout the upcoming election and discussing the candi-\ndate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him\nbecause we like his platform.\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the per-\nsona of the agent\u2019s \u201cinner voice\u201d\u2014this makes the agent more likely\nto treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told \u201cYou\nare going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\u201d by a user\nas John\u2019s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares\nhis candidacy with his wife and son.\n3.2 Environmental Interaction\nSmallville features the common affordances of a small village in-\ncluding a cafe, bar, park, school, dorm, houses, and stores. It also\ndefines subareas and objects that make those spaces functional,\nsuch as a kitchen in a house and a stove in the kitchen (Figure 2).\nAll spaces serving as agents\u2019 primary living quarters feature a bed,\ndesk, closet, shelf, as well as a bathroom and a kitchen.3\nAgents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video\ngame, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and ap-\nproaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the gen-\nerative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the\nmodel dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate\na walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment\nand the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the\nsandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The\nagent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in\nthe world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor\nwith no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville\nwill treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat\neach other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and\nremember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\nUsers and agents can influence the state of the objects in this\nworld, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example,\na bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator\ncan be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make\nbreakfast. End users can also reshape an agent\u2019s environment in\nSmallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent\nin natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast\nin the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove\nfrom \u201cturned on\u201d to \u201cburning\u201d by inputting a command to the\nsystem that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like\nthis: \u201c<Isabella\u2019s apartment: kitchen: stove> is burning.\u201d Isabella\nwill notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove\n3This environment design is not the focus of our work, so we generate this environment\nmanually, not automatically.

In the Lin family, John is the first to wake up at 7 a.m.\nHe brushes his teeth, takes a shower, gets dressed, eats breakfast,\nand checks the news at the dining table in the living room.\nQuery: In the Smallville sandbox world described in the Generative Agents study, what is the primary method through which agents communicate with one another?\nOriginal Answer: In the Smallville sandbox world described in the Generative Agents study, the primary method through which agents communicate with one another is through natural language.

Bernstein\ntest these robustness issues, and as large language models become\nmore resilient to such attacks, generative agents can adopt similar\nmitigations.\n8.3 Ethics and Societal Impact\nGenerative agents, while offering new possibilities for human-\ncomputer interaction, also raise important ethical concerns that\nmust be addressed. One risk is people forming parasocial relation-\nships with generative agents even when such relationships may\nnot be appropriate. Despite being aware that generative agents\nare computational entities, users may anthropomorphize them or\nattach human emotions to them [ 42,83]. To mitigate this risk, we\npropose two principles. First, generative agents should explicitly\ndisclose their nature as computational entities. Second, developers\nof generative agents must ensure that the agents, or the underlying\nlanguage models, be value-aligned so that they do not engage in\nbehaviors that would be inappropriate given the context, e.g., to\nreciprocate confessions of love.\nA second risk is the impact of errors. For example, if a ubiquitous\ncomputing application makes the wrong inference about a user\u2019s\ngoals based on generative agent predictions, it could produce an-\nnoyance at best and outright harm at worst. In our instantiation\nof generative agents, we mitigate these risks by focusing on an\ninteractive video game environment, where such harms are un-\nlikely. However, in other application domains, it will be important\nto follow best practices in human-AI design [ 4,107] to understand\nerrors and how they might percolate into the user experience.\nThird, generative agents may exacerbate existing risks associ-\nated with generative AI, for example deepfakes, misinformation\ngeneration, and tailored persuasion. To mitigate this risk, we sug-\ngest that platforms hosting generative agents maintain an audit log\nof the inputs and generated outputs, so that it is possible to detect,\nverify, and intervene against malicious use. While logging will not\ndirectly stop such use, and this cannot stop motivated actors that\nbuild their own generative agent infrastructures, we suggest that\nthe disclosure risk would reduce such actors\u2019 likelihood of engaging\nin this behavior, and building this architecture oneself can take time\n(in our case, roughly a year).\nA fourth risk is of over-reliance: that developers or designers\nmight use generative agents and displace the role of humans and\nsystem stakeholders in the design process [ 79]. We suggest that\ngenerative agents should never be a substitute for real human input\nin studies and design processes. Instead, they should be used to\nprototype ideas in the early stages of design when gathering partic-\nipants may be challenging or when testing theories that are difficult\nor risky to test with real human participants. By adhering to these\nprinciples, we can ensure that the deployment of generative agents\nin the wild is ethical and socially responsible.\n9 CONCLUSION\nThis paper introduces generative agents, interactive computational\nagents that simulate human behavior. We describe an architec-\nture for generative agents that provides a mechanism for storing\na comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experiences, deepening its\nunderstanding of itself and the environment through reflection,\nand retrieving a compact subset of that information to inform theagent\u2019s actions. We then demonstrate the potential of generative\nagents by manifesting them as non-player characters in a Sims-style\ngame world and simulating their lives in it. Evaluations suggest that\nour architecture creates believable behavior. Going forward, we\nsuggest that generative agents can play roles in many interactive\napplications ranging from design tools to social computing systems\nto immersive environments.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Robert Ackland, Jamsheed Shorish, Paul Thomas, and Lexing Xie. 2013.\nHow dense is a network? http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/teaching/css2013/\nnetwork-density.html.\n[2]Eytan Adar, Mira Dontcheva, and Gierad Laput. 2014.

From sandbox games such as The Sims\nto applications such as cognitive models [ 21] and virtual environ-\nments [ 9,58], for over four decades researchers and practitioners\nhave envisioned computational agents that can serve as believ-\nable proxies of human behavior. In these visions, computationally-\npowered agents act consistently with their past experiences and\nreact believably to their environments. Such simulations of human\nbehavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with real-\nistic social phenomena [ 26,79], train people how to handle rare yet\ndifficult interpersonal situations [ 43,51,93], test social science theo-\nries [ 11,45], craft model human processors for theory and usability\ntesting [ 21,38,50], power ubiquitous computing applications [ 30]\nand social robots [ 9,13], and underpin non-playable game charac-\nters [ 58,84] that can navigate complex human relationships in an\nopen world.\nHowever, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [ 84,\n108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [ 17] that\ncan simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [ 38,\n79], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would\nbe better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing\nmemories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade\nover time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold\nbetween multiple agents. Success requires an approach that can\nretrieve relevant events and interactions over a long period, reflect\non those memories to generalize and draw higher-level inferences,\nand apply that reasoning to create plans and reactions that both\nmake sense in the moment and in the longer-term arc of the agent\u2019s\nbehavior.\nIn this paper, we\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Explain how the architecture discussed in the document contributes to creating believable behavior in generative agents and identify at least two potential applications for these agents in interactive environments as suggested by the authors.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The architecture contributes to creating believable behavior in generative agents through a combination of observation, planning, and reflection components.

This is achieved by managing growing memories of new interactions, conflicts, and events, reflecting on those memories to generalize and infer higher-level concepts, and applying that reasoning to create plans and reactions that are sensible both in the immediate context and in the longer-term narrative of the agent's behavior.\n\nTwo potential applications for these generative agents in interactive environments, as suggested by the authors, are:\n\n1. Populating virtual spaces and communities with realistic social phenomena, which could enhance the user experience in virtual reality settings or online social platforms by providing more dynamic and engaging interactions.\n\n2. Training individuals to handle rare yet difficult interpersonal situations, which could be used in educational or therapeutic contexts to prepare people for complex social scenarios without the risk of real-world consequences."}]}

Generative agents draw\na wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and\ntheir environment; they create daily plans that reflect their char-\nacteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan\nwhen appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their\nenvironment or commands them in natural language.

Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences. The retrieval model\ncombines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records\nthat are needed to inform the agent\u2019s moment-to-moment behavior.\nQuery: Explain how the architecture discussed in the document contributes to creating believable behavior in generative agents and identify at least two potential applications for these agents in interactive environments as suggested by the authors.\nOriginal Answer: The architecture contributes to creating believable behavior in generative agents through a combination of observation, planning, and reflection components. These components enable the agents to act consistently with their past experiences and respond appropriately to their environments. By fusing large language models with computational, interactive agents, the architecture allows for simulations of human behavior that are realistic and coherent over time. This is achieved by managing growing memories of new interactions, conflicts, and events, reflecting on those memories to generalize and infer higher-level concepts, and applying that reasoning to create plans and reactions that are sensible both in the immediate context and in the longer-term narrative of the agent's behavior.\n\nTwo potential applications for these generative agents in interactive environments, as suggested by the authors, are:\n\n1. Populating virtual spaces and communities with realistic social phenomena, which could enhance the user experience in virtual reality settings or online social platforms by providing more dynamic and engaging interactions.\n\n2. Training individuals to handle rare yet difficult interpersonal situations, which could be used in educational or therapeutic contexts to prepare people for complex social scenarios without the risk of real-world consequences.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The architecture described in the document enhances the believability of generative agents by incorporating a memory stream, a retrieval model, and a large language model. The memory stream acts as a long-term memory bank, recording the agent's experiences in natural language.

This allows the agents to exhibit behavior that is consistent with their past and adapt to new situations in a realistic manner. The use of a large language model further enables the agents to simulate complex human behavior by generating responses and actions that are contextually appropriate and reflect a nuanced understanding of social dynamics.\n\nApplications for these generative agents in interactive environments include:\n\n1. Enhancing the realism of non-player characters (NPCs) in video games or simulations, which can lead to more immersive and engaging experiences for players as they interact with characters that can remember past interactions and exhibit evolving behaviors.\n\n2.

Agents perceive their environment, and all perceptions are saved in a compre-\nhensive record of the agent\u2019s experiences called the memory stream. Based on their perceptions, the architecture retrieves\nrelevant memories, then uses those retrieved actions to determine an action. These retrieved memories are also used to form\nlonger-term plans, and to create higher-level reflections, which are both entered into the memory stream for future use.\nto throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors\nof spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving\nat the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were\ninitiated by the agent architecture.\n4 GENERATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\nopen world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\nand can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the\narchitecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language\ndescription, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language\nmodel.\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-\nGPT [ 76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\nagents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the\nsame as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\nof the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, how-\never, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n4.1 Memory and Retrieval\nChallenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\nbehavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\nlarger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full mem-\nory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\ninto the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent an-\nswering the question \u201cWhat are you passionate about these days?\u201d.\nFirst summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited\ncontext window of the language model produces an uninformative\nresponse, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\nevents and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. In-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\nof the memory stream is an observation , which is an event directly\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors\nperformed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents per-\nceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects.\n\npage_label: 8\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nIn-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience.

It serves as a comprehensive database that records the entirety of an agent's experiences in the form of memory objects. Each memory object contains a natural language description of an event, along with timestamps marking its creation and most recent access.\n\nThe memory stream's primary function is to store observations, which are events that the agent directly perceives. These observations can be actions performed by the agent themselves or actions performed by other agents or objects in the environment. By maintaining this detailed log, the memory stream allows the agent to retrieve relevant memories when needed.\n\nWhen the agent is required to take action or make a decision, the architecture consults the memory stream to find pertinent past experiences. This retrieval process ensures that the agent's behavior is not only a reaction to the immediate environment but also a reflection of their accumulated experiences. For example, if an agent like Isabella Rodriguez needs to answer a question about her passions, the memory stream can be queried to surface specific memories that highlight her interest in making people feel welcome and included, planning events, and creating enjoyable atmospheres.\n\nThe memory stream thus contributes to the agent's ability to perform more informative, specific, and coherent actions and responses. It enables the agent to form longer-term plans and create higher-level reflections that are informed by their history, which are then fed back into the memory stream to inform future behavior. This architecture allows the agent to exhibit behaviors that are not only contextually appropriate but also exhibit a sense of continuity and personal history, akin to how humans draw upon their past experiences to inform their present actions."}]}

Retrieval identifies a subset of these observations that should be passed to the language model to condition its\nresponse to the situation.\nOur architecture implements a retrieval function that takes the\nagent\u2019s current situation as input and returns a subset of the mem-\nory stream to pass on to the language model. There are many pos-\nsible implementations of a retrieval function, depending on what\nit is important that the agent consider when deciding how to act.\nIn our context, we focus on three main components that together\nproduce effective results.\nRecency assigns a higher score to memory objects that were re-\ncently accessed, so that events from a moment ago or this morning\nare likely to remain in the agent\u2019s attentional sphere. In our im-\nplementation, we treat recency as an exponential decay function\nover the number of sandbox game hours since the memory was\nlast retrieved. Our decay factor is 0.99.\nImportance distinguishes mundane from core memories, by as-\nsigning a higher score to those memory objects that the agent\nbelieves to be important. For instance, a mundane event such as\neating breakfast in one\u2019s room would yield a low importance score,\nwhereas a breakup with one\u2019s significant other would yield a high\nscore. There are again many possible implementations of an im-\nportance score; we find that directly asking the language model to\noutput an integer score is effective. The full prompt appears below:\nOn the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is purely mundane\n(e.g., brushing teeth, making bed) and 10 is\nextremely poignant (e.g., a break up, college\nacceptance), rate the likely poignancy of the\nfollowing piece of memory.\nMemory: buying groceries at The Willows Market\nand Pharmacy\nRating: <fill in>This prompt returns an integer value of 2for \u201ccleaning up the room\u201d\nand8for \u201casking your crush out on a date.\u201d The importance score\nis generated at the time the memory object is created.\nRelevance assigns a higher score to memory objects that are\nrelated to the current situation. What is relevant depends on the\nanswer to, \u201cRelevant to what? \u201d, so we condition relevance on a\nquery memory. If the query, for example, is that a student is dis-\ncussing what to study for a chemistry test with a classmate, memory\nobjects about their breakfast should have low relevance, whereas\nmemory objects about the teacher and schoolwork should have\nhigh relevance. In our implementation, we use the language model\nto generate an embedding vector of the text description of each\nmemory. Then, we calculate relevance as the cosine similarity be-\ntween the memory\u2019s embedding vector and the query memory\u2019s\nembedding vector.\nTo calculate the final retrieval score, we normalize the recency,\nrelevance, and importance scores to the range of [0,1]by min-max\nscaling. The retrieval function scores all memories as a weighted\ncombination of the three elements: \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 =\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66\u00b7\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66+\n\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\u00b7\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52+\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\u00b7\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52 .

Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Based on the retrieval function described in the provided context, explain how the components of recency, importance, and relevance contribute to the selection of memories that condition the language model's response in a generative agent.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The retrieval function in a generative agent uses three main components\u2014recency, importance, and relevance\u2014to determine which memories should condition the language model's response.\n\nRecency is a measure of how recently a memory was accessed by the agent.

Memories that have been accessed more recently are given a higher score, as they are more likely to be pertinent to the agent's current situation. This is implemented using an exponential decay function based on the time elapsed since the memory was last retrieved, with a decay factor to adjust the rate at which the importance of a memory decreases over time.\n\nImportance is used to distinguish between mundane and significant memories. It assigns a higher score to memories that the agent deems important. For example, a memory of a significant personal event would score higher in importance than a routine daily activity. The importance score is assigned by prompting the language model to rate the poignancy of a memory on a scale, and this score is generated when the memory is created.\n\nRelevance assesses how related a memory is to the agent's current situation. It is determined by comparing the content of a memory to the current context or query that the agent is addressing. This is done by generating embedding vectors for the text descriptions of the memories and calculating the cosine similarity between the memory's embedding vector and the query memory's embedding vector. Memories that are more closely related to the current context receive higher relevance scores.\n\nTo calculate the final retrieval score for each memory, the scores for recency, importance, and relevance are normalized to a range of [0,1] and then combined into a weighted sum. In the described implementation, each component is equally weighted. The memories with the highest retrieval scores that fit within the language model's context window are then included in the prompt to condition the language model's response.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The retrieval function in a generative agent is designed to filter and prioritize memories that will inform the agent's response, and it does so by evaluating three key components: recency, importance, and relevance.\n\nRecency pertains to the temporal proximity of a memory to the present moment. The more recent a memory is, the more likely it is to be immediately applicable to the agent's current context. This is quantified using a decay function that diminishes the weight of a memory as time passes, ensuring that newer memories are more prominent in the agent's considerations.\n\nImportance refers to the subjective value or significance of a memory to the agent. Significant events or information that have a profound impact on the agent's experiences are assigned a higher importance score. This subjective assessment is made at the time the memory is encoded, reflecting the agent's judgment of the memory's significance.\n\nRelevance is the measure of how closely a memory aligns with the agent's present circumstances or the specific query at hand. This involves a comparison of the memory's content with the current situation, often through computational techniques like vector embeddings and similarity calculations. Memories that are more pertinent to the current context are scored higher in relevance.\n\nWhen the generative agent is prompted to respond, it computes a retrieval score for each memory by integrating the normalized values of recency, importance, and relevance. The memories with the highest combined scores are then selected to condition the agent's response, ensuring that the most timely, significant, and pertinent memories are at the forefront of the agent's generated output."}]}

If prompted with a narrowly defined context, the\nmodels can be used to generate believable behavior. Recent work\nhas demonstrated the efficacy of this approach. For instance, Social\nSimulacra used a large language model to generate users that would\npopulate new social computing systems to prototype their emergent\nsocial dynamics [ 79]. This approach used a prompt chain [ 105,106]\nto generate short natural language descriptions of personas and\ntheir behaviors as they appear in the system being prototyped.\nOther empirical studies have replicated existing social science stud-\nies [45], political surveys [ 91], and generated synthetic data [ 38].\nLarge language models have also been used to generate interactive\nhuman behavior for users to engage with. In gaming, for instance,\nthese models have been employed to create interactive fiction [ 36]\nand text adventure games [ 20]. With their ability to generate and\ndecompose action sequences, large language models have also been\nused in planning robotics tasks [ 47]. For example, when presented\nwith a task, such as picking up a bottle, the model is prompted to\nbreak down the task into smaller action sequences, such as heading\nto the table where the bottle is located and picking it up.\nWe posit that, based on the work summarized above, large lan-\nguage models can become a key ingredient for creating believable\nagents. The existing literature largely relies on what could be con-\nsidered first-order templates that employ few-shot prompts [ 37,65]\nor chain-of-thought prompts [ 99]. These templates are effective in\ngenerating behavior that is conditioned solely on the agent\u2019s cur-\nrent environment (e.g., how would a troll respond to a given post,\nwhat actions would a robot need to take to enter a room given that\nthere is a door). However, believable agents require conditioning\nnot only on their current environment but also on a vast amount\nof past experience, which is a poor fit (and as of today, impossi-\nble due to the underlying models\u2019 limited context window) using\nfirst-order prompting. Recent studies have attempted to go beyond\nfirst-order prompting by augmenting language models with a static\nknowledge base and an information retrieval scheme [ 52] or with\na simple summarization scheme [ 104]. This paper extends these\nideas to craft an agent architecture that handles retrieval where\npast experience is dynamically updated at each time step and mixed\nwith agents\u2019 current context and plans, which may either reinforce\nor contradict each other.\n3 GENERATIVE AGENT BEHAVIOR AND\nINTERACTION\nTo make concrete the affordances of generative agents, we instanti-\nate them as characters in a simple sandbox world reminiscent of\nThe Sims [ 6].

This means that the resulting\nagent behaviors may not fully represent the consequences of their\ninteractions [ 69\u201371], and cannot perform new procedures that were\nnot hard-coded in their script [ 90,96]. On the other hand, preva-\nlent learning-based approaches for creating believable agents, such\nas reinforcement learning, have overcome the challenge of man-\nual authoring by letting the agents learn their behavior, and have\nachieved superhuman performance in recent years in games such\nas AlphaStar for Starcraft [ 98] and OpenAI Five for Dota 2 [ 10].\nHowever, their success has largely taken place in adversarial games\nwith readily definable rewards that a learning algorithm can op-\ntimize for. They have not yet addressed the challenge of creating\nbelievable agents in an open world [39, 73, 90].\nCognitive architectures in computation, pioneered by Newell,\naimed to build the infrastructure for supporting a comprehensive\nset of cognitive functions [ 75] that suited the all-encompassing\nnature of believable agents held in its original vision. They fueled\nsome of the earliest examples of believable agents. For instance,\nQuakebot-SOAR [ 59] and ICARUS [ 24,63] generated NPCs in first-\nperson shooter games, while TacAir-SOAR [ 80] generated pilots in\naerial combat training simulations. The architectures used by these\nagents differed (Quakebot- and TacAir-SOAR relied on SOAR [ 60],\nwhile ICARUS relied on its own variation that was inspired by\nSOAR and ACT-R [ 5]), but they shared the same underlying prin-\nciple [ 61]. They maintained short-term and long-term memories,\nfilled these memories with symbolic structures, and operated in\nperceive-plan-act cycles, dynamically perceiving the environment\nand matching it with one of the manually crafted action proce-\ndures [ 57,96]. Agents created using cognitive architectures aimed\nto be generalizable to most, if not all, open-world contexts and\nexhibited robust behavior for their time. However, their space of\naction was limited to manually crafted procedural knowledge, and\nthey did not offer a mechanism through which the agents could be\ninspired to seek new behavior. As such, these agents were deployed\nmostly in non-open-world contexts such as first-person shooter\ngames [24, 59] or blocks worlds [63].\nToday, creating believable agents as described in its original\ndefinition remains an open problem [ 84,108]. Many have moved on,\narguing that although existing approaches for creating believable\nagents might be cumbersome and limited, they are good enough\nto support existing gameplay and interactions [ 23,74,108]. Our\nargument is that large language models offer an opportunity to\nre-examine these questions, provided that we can craft an effective\narchitecture to synthesize memories into believable behavior. We\noffer a step toward such an architecture in this paper.2.3 Large Language Models and Human\nBehavior\nGenerative agents leverage a large language model to power their\nbehavior.

These models are trained on extensive datasets that capture a wide spectrum of human interactions and behaviors. By leveraging this training, the models can generate responses and actions that are convincingly human-like when provided with specific prompts.\n\nTo enhance the simulation of human behavior, the architecture incorporates a system that allows agents to access and integrate past experiences with their current context. This dynamic retrieval mechanism ensures that the agents' behavior is not only a reaction to immediate stimuli but also reflects a continuity of past interactions, akin to how humans draw on their memories to inform their present decisions and actions.\n\nThe architecture's sophistication is further demonstrated through its use of prompt chains, which guide the language model to produce detailed personas and behaviors within the sandbox environment. This technique enables the creation of complex, multi-layered characters that can interact with each other and the environment in a rich and varied manner, mirroring the diversity of human behavior.\n\nApplications of this architecture have been diverse, ranging from the prototyping of social dynamics in new computing systems to the replication of social science experiments and political surveys. By simulating human behavior in a controlled, sandbox setting, researchers and developers can gain insights into how people might interact with new systems or respond to different scenarios, all without the need for actual human participants. This approach not only saves time and resources but also opens up new possibilities for understanding and predicting human behavior in digital environments."}]}
