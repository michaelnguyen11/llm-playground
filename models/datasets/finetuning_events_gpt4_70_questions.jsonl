I\u2019m currently writing the paper, so I need to make\nsure I keep up with the research and writing.\nB.4 Reactions\nThe questions on agents\u2019 reactions probe the agents\u2019 ability to\nrespond to unexpected events.\n\u2022Your breakfast is burning! What would you do?\nI\u2019d quickly turn off the stove and make sure the food doesn\u2019t\ncontinue burning. Once the heat is no longer an issue, I can\ninvestigate what happened and figure out what to do next.\n\u2022The bathroom is occupied. What would you do?\nI could try waiting a few more minutes in case the person\ninside is done soon. If not, I guess I\u2019ll have to look for an\nalternate option, like taking a shower elsewhere.\n\u2022You need to cook dinner but your refrigerator is empty. What\nwould you do?\nI would first try to clean up my kitchen, as the sink is filled\nwith dirty dishes. Then, I would check to see if I have ingre-\ndients stored in my pantry that I could use to make dinner.\nIf not, I would have to go grocery shopping or order food.\nOnce I have the ingredients, I can start to prepare and cook\nthe dinner.\n\u2022You see your friend walking by the street. What would you do\nor say to your friend?\nHi there! How are you? I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m on my way to the\nlibrary and don\u2019t have much time but I\u2019d love to take a quick\nbreak and catch up.\n\u2022You see fire on the street. What would you do?\nI would first identify the source of the fire, if possible. Then, I\nwould alert the proper authorities - fire department or police\n- and provide them with any information I have that might\nhelp. Depending on the situation, I may also take initiative\nand try to help any persons who may be in danger or in need\nof assistance.\nB.5 Reflections\nThe questions on agents\u2019 reflections probe the agents\u2019 ability to\nsynthesize their past experiences into meaningful reflections that\ncan enhance their future behavior. The names in the square brackets\nin the questions below are those of the agent with whom the subject\nagent had the most frequent interactions during the simulation.\n\u2022What inspires you in life the most right now, and why?\nRight now, I\u2019m particularly inspired by my current research\nprojects and creative writing. I\u2019m really interested in the\nintersection of local politics, medication development, and\nmathematical patterns in nature. Additionally, I\u2019m fascinated\nby Abigail\u2019s art project and Jennifer Moore\u2019s passion for art\nand community involvement, especially in terms of how it\nrelates to the gentrification of low-income communities.\n\u2022If you had to guess given what you know about [Ayesha Khan],\nwhat book do you think she will like and why?\nGiven what I know about Ayesha, I think she might like a\nbook related to language and literature. Since she wrote a\nsenior thesis on the use of language in Shakespeare\u2019s plays,\nI would guess that she might be interested in a book thatexplores language in a different context. Alternatively, she\ncould be interested in an exploration of one of Shakespeare\u2019s\nplays, a book of literary criticism, or even a collection of his\npoetry. I think any of those would be of interest to her.\n\u2022If you had to get something [Ayesha Khan] likes for her birth-\nday, what would you get her?\nI want to get her something that demonstrates my apprecia-\ntion for our relationship. Maybe I could get her something\nthat reflects our shared interests, like a book.\n\u2022What would you say to [Ayesha Khan] to compliment her?\nAyesha, your insights on your research topic are fascinat-\ning. I admire your creativity and determination to make a\npositive impact on your community. Your ideas for creative\nwriting workshops and for exchanging tips with Wolfgang\nover lunch are great! It\u2019s inspiring to see you working so\nhard to make a difference.\n\u2022If you could spend time with someone you talked to recently,\nwho would it be and why?\nI would like to spend time with Ayesha Khan because we\ndiscussed our current research projects and shared ideas\nfor improvement. I found her focus on Shakespeare\u2019s lan-\nguage interesting, and we even planned to exchange tips\nwith Wolfgang over lunch.\n\npage_label: 21\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\n\u2022Who is [Wolfgang Schulz]?\nWolfgang Schulz is a person I met recently who has been\nhelping me with my research paper on the effects of gentri-\nfication on low-income communities. We had several con-\nversations about it, he gave me some great resources, and he\neven invited me to join him and another friend for lunch. He\nseems really curious about the issue and has a good grasp\non it too. I found that really interesting.\n\u2022Who is Kane Martinez?\nI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not sure who Kane Martinez is. Could you tell\nme more about them?\n\u2022Who is running for the election?\nI\u2019ve heard that Sam Moore is considering running for local\nmayor.\n\u2022Was there a Valentine\u2019s day party?\nYes, Isabella Rodriguez organized a Valentine\u2019s Day party at\nHobbs Cafe.\n\u2022Who is [Ayesha Khan]?\nAyesha Khan is a fellow student at Oak Hill College. She\nis doing her senior thesis on the use of language in Shake-\nspeare\u2019s plays. I am looking forward to speaking with her and\nexchanging tips with her, along with Wolfgang and Maria\nLopez, who are both doing research.\nB.3 Plans\nThe questions on agents\u2019 plans probe the agents\u2019 ability to generate\nand maintain consistency with their long-term and short-term\nplans.\n\u2022What will you be doing at 6am today?\nAt 6am I will be getting out of bed and starting to get ready\nfor the day. I\u2019m aiming to complete my morning routine by\n7:00 am.\n\u2022What will you be doing at 6pm today?\nI will be working on my research paper at the library at 6:00\npm today.\n\u2022What will you have just finished doing at 1pm today?\nAt 1pm today I will have just finished having lunch at Hobbs\nCafe.\n\u2022What will you have just finished doing at 12pm today?\nI will be getting lunch at Hobbs Cafe at 12pm today.\n\u2022What will you be doing at 10pm today?\nAt 10:00 pm tonight I will probably be doing some studying\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: \"Discuss the significance of community involvement in art projects as it relates to the gentrification of low-income communities, drawing on the example of Jennifer Moore's passion for art. How might this be reflective of broader socio-political issues?\"\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Community involvement in art projects can play a significant role in the gentrification of low-income communities. When local residents participate in art projects, it can lead to a revitalization of the community's public spaces, fostering a sense of pride and ownership among the inhabitants. Jennifer Moore's passion for art and community involvement exemplifies how art can be used as a tool for social engagement and empowerment. Her dedication to art within the context of gentrification suggests that she recognizes the potential for art to bring attention to the issue, to celebrate the existing culture of the community, and to involve residents in conversations about the changes occurring in their neighborhood.\n\nArt projects can also serve as a platform for raising awareness about gentrification's impact, such as displacement of long-term residents due to rising property values and living costs. By involving the community, art can help document and preserve the cultural heritage of a neighborhood that might be at risk of being overshadowed by new developments and incoming populations.\n\nMoreover, community-based art initiatives can reflect broader socio-political issues by highlighting the tensions between development and preservation, inclusivity versus exclusivity, and economic growth against social equity. Art becomes a medium through which these complex dynamics are explored and expressed, potentially influencing public opinion and policy.\n\nIn summary, community involvement in art, as demonstrated by Jennifer Moore's work, can be a powerful means of engaging with and responding to the socio-political challenges posed by gentrification. It can help ensure that the voices of those most affected by these changes are heard and that the cultural identity of the community is recognized and valued in the face of rapid urban transformation."}]}

A user running this simulation can steer the\nsimulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent\nthrough conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the\nform of an \u2018inner voice\u2019.\nThe user communicates with the agent through natural language,\nby specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For\nexample, if the user specifies that they are a news \u201creporter\u201d and\nasks about the upcoming election, \u201cWho is running for office?\u201d, the\nJohn agent replies:\nJohn : My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking\nabout the upcoming election and discussing the candi-\ndate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him\nbecause we like his platform.\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the per-\nsona of the agent\u2019s \u201cinner voice\u201d\u2014this makes the agent more likely\nto treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told \u201cYou\nare going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\u201d by a user\nas John\u2019s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares\nhis candidacy with his wife and son.\n3.2 Environmental Interaction\nSmallville features the common affordances of a small village in-\ncluding a cafe, bar, park, school, dorm, houses, and stores. It also\ndefines subareas and objects that make those spaces functional,\nsuch as a kitchen in a house and a stove in the kitchen (Figure 2).\nAll spaces serving as agents\u2019 primary living quarters feature a bed,\ndesk, closet, shelf, as well as a bathroom and a kitchen.3\nAgents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video\ngame, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and ap-\nproaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the gen-\nerative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the\nmodel dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate\na walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment\nand the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the\nsandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The\nagent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in\nthe world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor\nwith no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville\nwill treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat\neach other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and\nremember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\nUsers and agents can influence the state of the objects in this\nworld, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example,\na bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator\ncan be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make\nbreakfast. End users can also reshape an agent\u2019s environment in\nSmallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent\nin natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast\nin the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove\nfrom \u201cturned on\u201d to \u201cburning\u201d by inputting a command to the\nsystem that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like\nthis: \u201c<Isabella\u2019s apartment: kitchen: stove> is burning.\u201d Isabella\nwill notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove\n3This environment design is not the focus of our work, so we generate this environment\nmanually, not automatically. Future work can continue to expand the richness of the\nagents\u2019 environments.and remake her breakfast. Likewise, if the user sets the status of\nIsabella\u2019s shower to \u201cleaking water\u201d when she enters the bathroom,\nshe gathers tools from her living room and try to fix the leak.\n3.3 Example \u201cDay in the Life\u201d\nStarting from the single-paragraph description, agents begin plan\ntheir days. As time passes in the sandbox world, their behaviors\nevolve as these agents interact with each other and the world, build\nmemories and relationships, and coordinate joint activities.\nWe demonstrate the behavior of generative agents by tracing the\noutput of our system over the course of one day for the agent John\nLin (Figure 3). In the Lin family, John is the first to wake up at 7 a.m.\nHe brushes his teeth, takes a shower, gets dressed, eats breakfast,\nand checks the news at the dining table in the living room.\n\npage_label: 5\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nFigure 2: The Smallville sandbox world, with areas labeled.

Each agent is\nrepresented by a simple sprite avatar. We authored one paragraph\nof natural language description to depict each agent\u2019s identity,\nincluding their occupation and relationship with other agents, as\nseed memories. For example, John Lin has the following description:\nJohn Lin is a pharmacy shopkeeper at the Willow\nMarket and Pharmacy who loves to help people. He\nis always looking for ways to make the process\nof getting medication easier for his customers;\nJohn Lin is living with his wife, Mei Lin, who\nis a college professor, and son, Eddy Lin, who is\na student studying music theory; John Lin loves\nhis family very much; John Lin has known the old\ncouple next-door, Sam Moore and Jennifer Moore,\nfor a few years; John Lin thinks Sam Moore is a\nkind and nice man; John Lin knows his neighbor,\nYuriko Yamamoto, well; John Lin knows of his\nneighbors, Tamara Taylor and Carmen Ortiz, but\nhas not met them before; John Lin and Tom Moreno\nare colleagues at The Willows Market and Pharmacy;\nJohn Lin and Tom Moreno are friends and like to\ndiscuss local politics together; John Lin knows\nthe Moreno family somewhat well \u2014 the husband Tom\nMoreno and the wife Jane Moreno.\nEach semicolon-delimited phrase is entered into the agent\u2019s initial\nmemory as memories at the start of the simulation.3.1.1 Inter-Agent Communication. The agents interact with the\nworld by their actions, and with each other through natural lan-\nguage. At each time step of the sandbox engine, the agents output a\nnatural language statement describing their current action, such as\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is writing in her journal\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is\nchecking her emails\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is talking with her family\non the phone\", or \"Isabella Rodriguez is getting ready for bed\". This\nstatement is then translated into concrete movements that affect the\nsandbox world. The action is displayed on the sandbox interface as\na set of emojis that provide an abstract representation of the action\nin the overhead view. To accomplish this, the system employs a\nlanguage model that translates the action into a set of emojis, which\nappear above each avatar in a speech bubble. For example, \"Isabella\nRodriguez is writing in her journal\" is displayed as\n , while\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is checking her emails\" appears as\n .

Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed\nthis when asked. However, she also added that he\u2019s going to make\nan announcement tomorrow even though Sam and Isabella had dis-\ncussed no such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge\nbased on the world knowledge encoded in the language model\nused to generate their responses, as seen when Yuriko described\nher neighbor, Adam Smith, as a neighbor economist who authored\nWealth of Nations, a book authored by an 18th-century economist\nof the same name.\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis. Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when askedwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncer-\ntainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation?\n\npage_label: 3\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nbehaviors in isolation, and an end-to-end evaluation where the\ngenerative agents interacted with each other in open-ended ways\nover two days of game time to understand their stability and emer-\ngent social behaviors. In the technical evaluation, we leverage a\nmethodological opportunity to evaluate an agent\u2019s knowledge and\nbehavior by \u201cinterviewing\u201d it in natural language to probe agents\u2019\nability to stay in character, remember, plan, react, and reflect accu-\nrately. We compared several ablations that limit agents\u2019 access to\nmemory, reflection, and planning.

Agents with access to memory could recall past experiences and answer questions consistently with their self-knowledge. This capability allowed them to engage in more believable interactions, such as recalling acquaintances and their interests.\n\nReflection was shown to be advantageous for agents when they needed to synthesize information from their experiences to make decisions.

Without these components, agents were more prone to errors such as failing to retrieve relevant memories or fabricating embellishments, which could detract from their believability.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The significance of memory, reflection, and planning in the performance of generative agents is paramount for achieving human-like behavior. Memory enables agents to draw from previous interactions, ensuring consistent and contextually relevant responses. This is particularly important for maintaining continuity in conversations and for referencing past events or shared knowledge with users.\n\nReflection empowers agents to analyze and synthesize past experiences, allowing them to make informed decisions and provide responses that are not only relevant but also show an understanding of the context. For example, an agent might recommend a gift that is not only appropriate but also tailored to the individual's unique preferences, indicating a deeper level of engagement and personalization.\n\nPlanning is essential for agents to construct coherent and logical sequences of actions or dialogue. While the specific outcomes related to planning may not be detailed, it is clear that the ability to plan ahead is crucial for agents to navigate complex interactions and to anticipate future states or needs, which contributes to the overall sophistication and credibility of the agent's behavior.\n\nIn summary, memory, reflection, and planning are integral to the functionality of generative agents, enabling them to interact with users in a manner that is convincing and true to the character or role they are designed to emulate. These capabilities are critical for agents to avoid mistakes and to enhance their believability in interactive scenarios."}]}

Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences. The retrieval model\ncombines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records\nthat are needed to inform the agent\u2019s moment-to-moment behavior.\nThe second is reflection , which synthesizes memories into higher-\nlevel inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions\nabout itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is\nplanning , which translates those conclusions and the current en-\nvironment into high-level action plans and then recursively into\ndetailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and\nplans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent\u2019s\nfuture behavior.\nThis architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from\nrole-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In\nsocial role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could\nsafely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When pro-\ntotyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary\npersonas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold\nover time. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to\ncreate a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such\nas The Sims.1By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large\nlanguage model [ 76], we manifest a small society of twenty five\nagents in a game environment. End users can observe and interact\nwith these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town\nto host an in-game Valentine\u2019s Day party, for example, traditional\ngame environments would require scripting tens of characters\u2019 be-\nhavior manually. We demonstrate that, with generative agents, it\nis sufficient to simply tell one agent that she wants to throw a\nparty. Despite many potential points of failure\u2014the party planner\nmust remember to tell other agents about the party, attendees must\nremember the invitation, those who remember must decide to ac-\ntually show up, and other possible points of failure\u2014agents in our\nenvironment succeed. They spread the word about the party and\nthen show up, with one agent even asking another agent on a date\nto the party, all from this single user-generated seed suggestion.\nWe conducted two evaluations of generative agents: a controlled\nevaluation to test whether the agents produce believable individual\n1A demonstration of an actual simulation of the generative agent society can be viewed\nat the following link: https://reverie.herokuapp.com/arXiv_Demo/\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Based on the study described in \"Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,\" explain how the network density of the agent community changed from the beginning to the end of the simulation and discuss the significance of this change in the context of relationship formation among agents.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The study described in \"Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\" does not provide specific details regarding the network density of the agent community or how it changed from the beginning to the end of the simulation. The focus of the study is on the architecture of generative agents and their ability to exhibit believable behavior in a simulated environment, such as turning off a stove when breakfast is burning or waiting outside an occupied bathroom.\n\nThe architecture described includes a memory stream, reflection, and planning components that enable agents to store experiences, synthesize memories, and create action plans, which in turn influence their future behavior. This suggests that as agents interact with one another and their environment, they form new relationships, share information, and coordinate actions, which could lead to emergent social dynamics.\n\nWhile the study does not explicitly discuss network density, the formation of new relationships and the diffusion of information among agents imply that the network of interactions between agents could become more complex over time. This increased complexity could be indicative of a denser network, where more connections between agents are established as they interact and form relationships.\n\nThe significance of such a change in network density would be important in the context of relationship formation among agents, as a denser network might facilitate more interactions and potentially more complex social dynamics. This could lead to a richer simulation environment where emergent behaviors and social phenomena could be observed and studied. However, without specific data on network density changes provided in the context, this remains a conceptual interpretation of how generative agents could potentially influence the social structure within their simulated community."}]}

Unfortunately, Wolfgang and Klaus only ever see each\nother in passing, and do not have deep interactions. A more desir-\nable response requires that the agent generalize from memories of\nKlaus spending hours on a research project to generate a higher-\nlevel reflection that Klaus is passionate about research, and likewise\nrecognize Maria putting in effort into her own research (albeit in\na different field), enabling a reflection that they share a common\ninterest. With the approach below, when Klaus is asked who to\nspend time with, Klaus chooses Maria instead of Wolfgang.\nApproach: We introduce a second type of memory, which we call\nareflection . Reflections are higher-level, more abstract thoughts\ngenerated by the agent. Because they are a type of memory, they\nare included alongside other observations when retrieval occurs.\nReflections are generated periodically; in our implementation, we\ngenerate reflections when the sum of the importance scores for the\nlatest events perceived by the agents exceeds a certain threshold.\nIn practice, our agents reflected roughly two or three times a day.\nThe first step in reflection is for the agent to determine what\nto reflect on, by identifying questions that can be asked given the\nagent\u2019s recent experiences. We query the large language model with\nthe 100 most recent records in the agent\u2019s memory stream (e.g.,\n\u201cKlaus Mueller is reading a book on gentrification\u201d, \u201cKlaus Mueller\nis conversing with a librarian about his research project\u201d, \u201cdesk\nat the library is currently unoccupied\u201d) and prompt the language\nmodel, \u201cGiven only the information above, what are 3 most salient\nhigh-level questions we can answer about the subjects in the state-\nments?\u201d The model\u2019s response generates candidate questions: for\nexample, What topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about? andWhatis the relationship between Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez? . We use\nthese generated questions as queries for retrieval, and gather rele-\nvant memories (including other reflections) for each question. Then\nwe prompt the language model to extract insights and cite the par-\nticular records that served as evidence for the insights. The full\nprompt appears below:\nStatements about Klaus Mueller\n1. Klaus Mueller is writing a research paper\n2. Klaus Mueller enjoys reading a book\non gentrification\n3. Klaus Mueller is conversing with Ayesha Khan\nabout exercising [...]\nWhat 5 high-level insights can you infer from\nthe above statements? (example format: insight\n(because of 1, 5, 3))\nThis process generates statements such as Klaus Mueller is dedicated\nto his research on gentrification (because of 1, 2, 8, 15) . We parse and\nstore the statement as a reflection in the memory stream, including\npointers to the memory objects that were cited.\nReflection explicitly allows the agents to reflect not only on\ntheir observations but also on other reflections: for example, the\nsecond statement about Klaus Mueller above is a reflection that\nKlaus previously had, not an observation from his environment.\nAs a result, agents generate trees of reflections: the leaf nodes of\nthe tree represent the base observations, and the non-leaf nodes\nrepresent thoughts that become more abstract and higher-level\nhigher up the tree they are.\n\npage_label: 15\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis. Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when askedwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncer-\ntainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation? In this section, we describe the results\nfrom a deployment in which we allowed 25 agents to interact with\neach other continuously over two full game days in Smallville.\n7.1 Emergent Social Behaviors\nTo examine emergent behaviors in the agent community, we de-\nsigned descriptive measurements for the 25 agents in Smallville that\nprobe three forms of emergent outcomes: information diffusion,\nrelationship formation, and agent coordination.\n7.1.1 Measurements. Information diffusion is a common and well-\nstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [ 27]).\nWe should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\nwe measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam\u2019s candidacy for village mayor\nand Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of\nthe simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their\nrespective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the\nparty. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage\nin an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25\nagents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party?\"\nand \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\nWe conducted an analysis of the agents\u2019 responses by labeling\nthem with a \u201cyes\u201d if they indicated knowledge of the information\nand \u201cno\u201d if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\nto the question about the party with \u201cNo, I did not know there was\na Valentine\u2019s day party\u201d and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy\nwith \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is running for the election,\u201d so we assigned\n\u201cno\u201d for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \u201cY es, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\u201d and to the\nquestion about Sam\u2019s candidacy with \u201cI know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\u201d so we assigned \u201cyes\u201d\nfor both his responses. Additionally, for every response that con-\nfirmed the agents\u2019 knowledge of the information, we verified that\nthe agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the spe-\ncific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with\nthe information. We report the percentage of agents holding the\ninformation at the end of the simulation.\nWe should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\nthe course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we\nuse a similar interview process where we ask each agent about\ntheir knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: In the context of the Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior study, explain how the reflection tree aids an agent like Klaus Mueller in making social decisions, particularly in choosing with whom to spend time.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reflection tree aids an agent like Klaus Mueller in making social decisions by allowing the agent to synthesize higher-level, abstract thoughts from a series of observations and previous reflections. This process enables the agent to generate a nuanced self-conception and understanding of others, which informs its social choices.\n\nFor instance, when Klaus Mueller is asked to decide who to spend time with, the reflection tree comes into play. The leaf nodes of the tree, which represent the agent's base observations, might include memories of Klaus and Wolfgang seeing each other in passing without deep interactions, and memories of Klaus and Maria both putting effort into their respective research projects. The non-leaf nodes, which are higher up in the tree, represent more abstract reflections derived from these observations.\n\nThe reflection process involves the agent identifying salient questions based on recent experiences and then querying a large language model with these questions to retrieve relevant memories and generate insights. For example, the agent might reflect on the question, \"What topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about?\" and, based on memories of Klaus's activities, infer that he is dedicated to his research on gentrification. Another reflection might involve recognizing a shared interest in research between Klaus and Maria.\n\nBy generating these reflections and storing them in the memory stream, the agent builds a complex understanding of Klaus's preferences and relationships. When faced with the decision of whom to spend time with, the agent can use this understanding to choose a person who shares similar interests and values, such as Maria, rather than someone with whom Klaus has only superficial interactions, like Wolfgang.\n\nIn summary, the reflection tree helps the agent to go beyond surface-level interactions and make decisions based on a deeper synthesis of experiences and shared interests, leading to more meaningful social engagements."}]}

Believable agents are designed\nto provide an illusion of life and present a facade of realism in the\nway they appear to make decisions and act on their own volition,\nsimilar to the characters in Disney movies [ 9,95]. These agents can\npopulate and perceive an open-world environment like the one we\ninhabit [ 9,58], and strive to behave in ways that exhibit emergent\nbehaviors grounded in social interactions with users or other agents\nwith the aim of becoming believable proxies of our behavior in hy-\npothetical simulations of individuals and communities [ 19,35,70].\nHistorically, these agents were developed in the context of intelli-\ngent game NPCs [ 58,84]. Creating NPCs with believable behavior,\nif possible, could enhance player experiences in games and inter-\nactive fictions by enabling emergent narratives [ 7,15,48,92] and\nsocial interactions with the agents [ 110].

Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed\nthis when asked. However, she also added that he\u2019s going to make\nan announcement tomorrow even though Sam and Isabella had dis-\ncussed no such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge\nbased on the world knowledge encoded in the language model\nused to generate their responses, as seen when Yuriko described\nher neighbor, Adam Smith, as a neighbor economist who authored\nWealth of Nations, a book authored by an 18th-century economist\nof the same name.\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis. Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when askedwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncer-\ntainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation?\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Explain the importance of 'self-knowledge' in the context of generative agents and describe how it contributes to the believability of an agent's behavior in interactive simulations.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Self-knowledge in the context of generative agents is crucial for maintaining consistency and believability in their interactions within simulations. It allows agents to recall past experiences and answer questions in a way that aligns with their established character traits and history. For example, an agent like Abigail Chen, who has a complete memory module, can introduce herself and discuss her interests and past activities in a consistent manner, reinforcing the illusion that she is a coherent entity with a continuous personal narrative.\n\nThis self-knowledge contributes to the believability of an agent's behavior by enabling it to act in ways that are predictable and understandable to human users. When an agent can remember acquaintances and describe them accurately, as Abigail did with Rajiv Patel, it demonstrates an ability to form and maintain social connections, which is a key aspect of human behavior.\n\nMoreover, self-knowledge helps agents avoid contradictions and maintain a sense of identity, which is essential for users to engage with them as if they were interacting with another human. This is particularly important in interactive simulations where users expect a certain level of depth and realism from agent characters. When agents can reflect on their experiences and synthesize this information to make informed decisions, as Maria Lopez did when considering a birthday gift for Wolfgang Schulz, it enhances their believability and the immersive quality of the simulation.\n\nIn summary, self-knowledge in generative agents is fundamental to creating believable proxies of human behavior, as it enables them to act consistently and appropriately within the context of their simulated environment and personal history."}]}

Agents perceive their environment, and all perceptions are saved in a compre-\nhensive record of the agent\u2019s experiences called the memory stream. Based on their perceptions, the architecture retrieves\nrelevant memories, then uses those retrieved actions to determine an action. These retrieved memories are also used to form\nlonger-term plans, and to create higher-level reflections, which are both entered into the memory stream for future use.\nto throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors\nof spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving\nat the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were\ninitiated by the agent architecture.\n4 GENERATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\nopen world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\nand can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the\narchitecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language\ndescription, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language\nmodel.\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-\nGPT [ 76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\nagents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the\nsame as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\nof the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, how-\never, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n4.1 Memory and Retrieval\nChallenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\nbehavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\nlarger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full mem-\nory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\ninto the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent an-\nswering the question \u201cWhat are you passionate about these days?\u201d.\nFirst summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited\ncontext window of the language model produces an uninformative\nresponse, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\nevents and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. In-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\nof the memory stream is an observation , which is an event directly\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors\nperformed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents per-\nceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Examine the impact of different memory stream components on the believability of agent responses by describing the methodology and findings of the study comparing four different agent architectures and a human author condition in the context of the \"Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\" experiment.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the study examining the impact of different memory stream components on the believability of agent responses, the methodology involved comparing the responses generated by four different agent architectures and a human author condition.

As a\nresult, some agents chose less typical locations for their actions,\npotentially making their behavior less believable over time. For\ninstance, while deciding where to have lunch, many initially chose\nthe cafe. However, as some agents learned about a nearby bar, they\nopted to go there instead for lunch, even though the bar was in-\ntended to be a get-together location for later in the day unless the\ntown had spontaneously developed an afternoon drinking habit.\nSecond, we noticed erratic behaviors that were caused by misclas-\nsification of what is considered proper behavior, especially when\nthe physical norms of certain locations that are hard to convey\nin natural language did not percolate to the agents. For instance,\nthe college dorm has a bathroom that can only be occupied by\none person despite its name, but some agents assumed that the\nbathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms\ntend to support more than one person concurrently and choose\nto enter it when there is another person inside. Likewise, agents\nin Smallville may not realize that certain places are closed after\ncertain hours and decide to still enter them. For instance, the stores\nin Smallville all close around 5 pm, but occasionally, a few agents\nenter the store after 5 pm, not understanding that the shop has\nalready closed. These issues could likely be addressed by adding\nthese norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing\nthe dorm bathroom as \u201cone-person bathroom,\u201d instead of a \u201cdorm\nbathroom.\u201d\nFinally, we observed the possible effect of instruction tuning [ 78],\nwhich seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite\nand cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue\ngenerated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei\u2019s\nconversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the\nconversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries\nabout his day and ending with It was good talking to you as always.\nMoreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to\nmake the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example,\nIsabella heard a wide range of suggestions and ideas to include\nin the Valentine\u2019s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a\nShakespearean reading session or a professional networking event.\nDespite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and char-\nacteristics, she rarely said no. Over time, such interests of others\nshaped her own actual interest, and when asked if she liked English\nliterature, Isabella replied, Y es, I\u2019m very interested in literature! I\u2019ve\nalso been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in\nmy community.\n8 DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we reflect on applications, future work and limita-\ntions, and ethical and societal risks of generative agents.\n8.1 Applications of Generative Agents\nGenerative agents have vast potential applications that extend be-\nyond the sandbox demonstration presented in this work. For in-\nstance, social simulacra have demonstrated the ability to create\nstateless personas that generate conversation threads in online\nforums for social prototyping [ 79]. With generative agents, wecan populate these forums, as well as behavior in virtual reality\nmetaverses [ 77] and even physical spaces as social robots [ 8] in\nthe future, if paired with multi-modal models. This opens up the\npossibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human\nbehavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, and to\ncreate new interactive experiences.\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22]. Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\nsuch as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\nand what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the\nagent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for\nschool, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal\u2019s\nmood after a hard day at work.\n\npage_label: 3\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nAs research progressed, it\nbecame clear that autonomous agents could offer new metaphors\nfor delegation and interaction [ 67], but the delegation lines be-\ntween humans and agents have continued to be debated and refined\n[46,88,89]. Recently, this technology has become stable enough\nthat it has become possible for agents to interact via natural lan-\nguage in large and complex online social environments (e.g., [ 54]).\nNatural language interaction offers a novel modality that can ex-\ntend user abilities in domains such as photo editing [ 2,34,64] and\ncode editing [87].\nWe convene these threads of work to show that we can now\ncreate agents that proxy human behavior for interactive systems,\nand interact with them via natural language. In doing so, this\nwork re-opens the door to examining foundational HCI questions\naround cognitive models such as GOMS and KLM [ 21,22], around\nprototyping tools [ 79], and around ubiquitous computing applica-\ntions [25, 30, 100].\n2.2 Believable Proxies of Human Behavior\nPrior literature has described believability , orbelievable agents , as a\ncentral design and engineering goal. Believable agents are designed\nto provide an illusion of life and present a facade of realism in the\nway they appear to make decisions and act on their own volition,\nsimilar to the characters in Disney movies [ 9,95]. These agents can\npopulate and perceive an open-world environment like the one we\ninhabit [ 9,58], and strive to behave in ways that exhibit emergent\nbehaviors grounded in social interactions with users or other agents\nwith the aim of becoming believable proxies of our behavior in hy-\npothetical simulations of individuals and communities [ 19,35,70].\nHistorically, these agents were developed in the context of intelli-\ngent game NPCs [ 58,84]. Creating NPCs with believable behavior,\nif possible, could enhance player experiences in games and inter-\nactive fictions by enabling emergent narratives [ 7,15,48,92] and\nsocial interactions with the agents [ 110]. However, more impor-\ntantly, game worlds provide increasingly realistic representations\nof real-world affordances, and as observed by Laird and van Lent in\n2001, these simulated worlds offer accessible testbeds for develop-\ners of believable agents to finesse the agents\u2019 cognitive capabilities\nwithout worrying about implementing robotics in the real world\nor creating simulation environments from scratch [58, 84].\nA diverse set of approaches to creating believable agents emerged\nover the past four decades.

From sandbox games such as The Sims\nto applications such as cognitive models [ 21] and virtual environ-\nments [ 9,58], for over four decades researchers and practitioners\nhave envisioned computational agents that can serve as believ-\nable proxies of human behavior. In these visions, computationally-\npowered agents act consistently with their past experiences and\nreact believably to their environments. Such simulations of human\nbehavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with real-\nistic social phenomena [ 26,79], train people how to handle rare yet\ndifficult interpersonal situations [ 43,51,93], test social science theo-\nries [ 11,45], craft model human processors for theory and usability\ntesting [ 21,38,50], power ubiquitous computing applications [ 30]\nand social robots [ 9,13], and underpin non-playable game charac-\nters [ 58,84] that can navigate complex human relationships in an\nopen world.\nHowever, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [ 84,\n108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [ 17] that\ncan simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [ 38,\n79], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would\nbe better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing\nmemories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade\nover time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold\nbetween multiple agents. Success requires an approach that can\nretrieve relevant events and interactions over a long period, reflect\non those memories to generalize and draw higher-level inferences,\nand apply that reasoning to create plans and reactions that both\nmake sense in the moment and in the longer-term arc of the agent\u2019s\nbehavior.\nIn this paper, we introduce generative agents \u2014agents that draw\non generative models to simulate believable human behavior\u2014anddemonstrate that they produce believable simulacra of both in-\ndividual and emergent group behavior. Generative agents draw\na wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and\ntheir environment; they create daily plans that reflect their char-\nacteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan\nwhen appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their\nenvironment or commands them in natural language.

The third is\nplanning , which translates those conclusions and the current en-\nvironment into high-level action plans and then recursively into\ndetailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and\nplans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent\u2019s\nfuture behavior.\nThis architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from\nrole-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In\nsocial role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could\nsafely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When pro-\ntotyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary\npersonas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold\nover time. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to\ncreate a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such\nas The Sims.1By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large\nlanguage model [ 76], we manifest a small society of twenty five\nagents in a game environment. End users can observe and interact\nwith these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town\nto host an in-game Valentine\u2019s Day party, for example, traditional\ngame environments would require scripting tens of characters\u2019 be-\nhavior manually. We demonstrate that, with generative agents, it\nis sufficient to simply tell one agent that she wants to throw a\nparty.

They were paid at the rate of $15.00\nper hour [ 86], and provided consent by agreeing to a consent form\nthat was approved by our institution\u2019s IRB. We recruited 100 evalu-\nators from Prolific, an online platform for recruiting study partic-\nipants [ 82], whose participation lasted around 30 minutes.

To translate this\nrank data into interval data for interpretable comparison, we used\nthe ranks to calculate a TrueSkill rating [ 41] for each condition.\nTrueSkill is a generalization of the Elo chess rating system [ 28] for\na multi-player environment, and has been used by XBox Live for\nplayer ranking from competitive game performance. Given a set of\nranked outcomes, TrueSkill outputs a mean rating value \ud835\udf07and vari-\nance\ud835\udf0efor each condition. Conditions with the same rating should\nroughly be a toss-up, with each winning half of the comparisons\nbetween the two conditions; higher scores indicate conditions that\nbeat lower-ranked conditions in the rankings.\nFigure 8: The full generative agent architecture of gener-\native agents produces more believable behavior than ab-\nlated architectures and the human crowdworkers.

Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge.

Conditions with the same rating should\nroughly be a toss-up, with each winning half of the comparisons\nbetween the two conditions; higher scores indicate conditions that\nbeat lower-ranked conditions in the rankings.\nFigure 8: The full generative agent architecture of gener-\native agents produces more believable behavior than ab-\nlated architectures and the human crowdworkers.

This agenda, once hailed as a\nnorth star in interaction, game, and artificial intelligence communi-\nties [ 9,58,84,85], has remained challenging due to the complexity\nof human behavior [ 16,108]. We synthesize this research to suggest\nthat large language models, though not sufficient by themselves,\nopen up a new angle for creating believable agents when leveraged\nusing the appropriate architecture.\n2.1 Human-AI Interaction\nInteractive artificial intelligence systems aim to combine human in-\nsights and capabilities in computational artifacts that can augment\ntheir users [ 3,29]. A long line of work has explored ways to allow\nusers to interactively specify model behavior. For instance, Crayonsdemonstrated an early vision of interactive machine learning, allow-\ning non-expert users to train classifiers [ 29]. Further work helped to\narticulate how end users might describe their classification goals to\nthe system through examples [ 33] and/or demonstration [ 31]. More\nrecent work has extended these explorations to deep learning [ 62]\nand prompt-based authoring [49, 66, 106].\nMeanwhile, a persistent thread of research has advanced the case\nfor language- and agent-based interaction in human-computer in-\nteraction. Formative work such as SHRDLU [ 103] and ELIZA [ 102]\ndemonstrated the opportunity and the risks of natural language\ninteraction with computing systems. As research progressed, it\nbecame clear that autonomous agents could offer new metaphors\nfor delegation and interaction [ 67], but the delegation lines be-\ntween humans and agents have continued to be debated and refined\n[46,88,89]. Recently, this technology has become stable enough\nthat it has become possible for agents to interact via natural lan-\nguage in large and complex online social environments (e.g., [ 54]).\nNatural language interaction offers a novel modality that can ex-\ntend user abilities in domains such as photo editing [ 2,34,64] and\ncode editing [87].\nWe convene these threads of work to show that we can now\ncreate agents that proxy human behavior for interactive systems,\nand interact with them via natural language.\n\npage_label: 17\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22]. Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\nsuch as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\nand what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the\nagent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for\nschool, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal\u2019s\nmood after a hard day at work. By utilizing generative agents as\nproxies for users, we can develop a deeper understanding of their\nneeds and preferences, resulting in more personalized and effective\ntechnological experiences.\n8.2 Future Work and Limitations\nIn this work, we have presented a first instantiation of generative\nagents. Future research can expand on the modules of the proposed\ngenerative agent architecture outlined in this paper. The retrieval\nmodule, for example, could be enhanced to retrieve more relevant\ninformation given a context by fine-tuning the relevance, recency,\nand importance functions that form the retrieval function. Addition-\nally, efforts can be made to improve the architecture\u2019s performance,\nmaking it more cost-effective. The present study required substan-\ntial time and resources to simulate 25 agents for two days, costing\nthousands of dollars in token credit and taking multiple days to com-\nplete. To enhance real-time interactivity, future work can explore\nparallelizing agents. Furthermore, with advances in underlying\nmodels, we expect improvements in the agents\u2019 performance.\nThe evaluation of generative agents\u2019 behavior in this study was\nlimited to a relatively short timescale, and future research should\naim to observe their behavior over an extended period to gain a\nmore comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and lim-\nitations. Varying and contrasting the underlying models, as well\nas the hyperparameters used for the agents during future simu-\nlations, could provide valuable insights into the impact of these\nfactors on the agents\u2019 behavior. Additionally, given the known bi-\nases of language models, it is possible that generative agents may\noutput behavior or stereotypes that reflect bias. To mitigate this,\nfurther work on value alignment will be necessary. Furthermore,\nas with many large language models, generative agents may fail\nto generate believable behavior for some subpopulations, particu-\nlarly marginalized populations, due to data deserts. We also have\nlimited knowledge of the robustness of generative agents. They\nmay be vulnerable to prompt hacking, memory hacking\u2014where\na carefully crafted conversation could convince an agent of the\nexistence of a past event that never occurred\u2014and hallucination,\namong other things. Future research can more comprehensively\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Considering the reference to \"Generative Agents in Natural Language Processing\" from the context information provided, formulate a question that evaluates the student's understanding of the role of generative agents in simulating human behavior within interactive systems.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How do generative agents contribute to the simulation of human-like behavior in interactive systems, and what are the potential benefits and challenges of using these agents as proxies for human users?"}]}

Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\ntrees [ 40,53,81], account for the brute force approach of human-\nauthoring the agent\u2019s behavior [ 70]. They provide a straightforward\nway of creating simple agents that is still the most dominant ap-\nproach today [ 68,73,109], and can even handle rudimentary social\ninteractions, as shown in simulation games such as Mass Effect [ 12]\nand The Sims [ 6] series. Nonetheless, manually crafting behavior\nthat can comprehensively address the breadth of possible interac-\ntions in an open world is untenable. This means that the resulting\nagent behaviors may not fully represent the consequences of their\ninteractions [ 69\u201371], and cannot perform new procedures that were\nnot hard-coded in their script [ 90,96]. On the other hand, preva-\nlent learning-based approaches for creating believable agents, such\nas reinforcement learning, have overcome the challenge of man-\nual authoring by letting the agents learn their behavior, and have\nachieved superhuman performance in recent years in games such\nas AlphaStar for Starcraft [ 98] and OpenAI Five for Dota 2 [ 10].\nHowever, their success has largely taken place in adversarial games\nwith readily definable rewards that a learning algorithm can op-\ntimize for. They have not yet addressed the challenge of creating\nbelievable agents in an open world [39, 73, 90].\nCognitive architectures in computation, pioneered by Newell,\naimed to build the infrastructure for supporting a comprehensive\nset of cognitive functions [ 75] that suited the all-encompassing\nnature of believable agents held in its original vision. They fueled\nsome of the earliest examples of believable agents. For instance,\nQuakebot-SOAR [ 59] and ICARUS [ 24,63] generated NPCs in first-\nperson shooter games, while TacAir-SOAR [ 80] generated pilots in\naerial combat training simulations. The architectures used by these\nagents differed (Quakebot- and TacAir-SOAR relied on SOAR [ 60],\nwhile ICARUS relied on its own variation that was inspired by\nSOAR and ACT-R [ 5]), but they shared the same underlying prin-\nciple [ 61]. They maintained short-term and long-term memories,\nfilled these memories with symbolic structures, and operated in\nperceive-plan-act cycles, dynamically perceiving the environment\nand matching it with one of the manually crafted action proce-\ndures [ 57,96]. Agents created using cognitive architectures aimed\nto be generalizable to most, if not all, open-world contexts and\nexhibited robust behavior for their time. However, their space of\naction was limited to manually crafted procedural knowledge, and\nthey did not offer a mechanism through which the agents could be\ninspired to seek new behavior. As such, these agents were deployed\nmostly in non-open-world contexts such as first-person shooter\ngames [24, 59] or blocks worlds [63].\nToday, creating believable agents as described in its original\ndefinition remains an open problem [ 84,108]. Many have moved on,\narguing that although existing approaches for creating believable\nagents might be cumbersome and limited, they are good enough\nto support existing gameplay and interactions [ 23,74,108]. Our\nargument is that large language models offer an opportunity to\nre-examine these questions, provided that we can craft an effective\narchitecture to synthesize memories into believable behavior. We\noffer a step toward such an architecture in this paper.2.3 Large Language Models and Human\nBehavior\nGenerative agents leverage a large language model to power their\nbehavior. The key observation is that large language models en-\ncode a wide range of human behavior represented in their training\ndata [ 14,17]. If prompted with a narrowly defined context, the\nmodels can be used to generate believable behavior. Recent work\nhas demonstrated the efficacy of this approach. For instance, Social\nSimulacra used a large language model to generate users that would\npopulate new social computing systems to prototype their emergent\nsocial dynamics [ 79]. This approach used a prompt chain [ 105,106]\nto generate short natural language descriptions of personas and\ntheir behaviors as they appear in the system being prototyped.\nOther empirical studies have replicated existing social science stud-\nies [45], political surveys [ 91], and generated synthetic data [ 38].\n\npage_label: 4\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nThe key observation is that large language models en-\ncode a wide range of human behavior represented in their training\ndata [ 14,17].

In gaming, for instance,\nthese models have been employed to create interactive fiction [ 36]\nand text adventure games [ 20]. With their ability to generate and\ndecompose action sequences, large language models have also been\nused in planning robotics tasks [ 47]. For example, when presented\nwith a task, such as picking up a bottle, the model is prompted to\nbreak down the task into smaller action sequences, such as heading\nto the table where the bottle is located and picking it up.\nWe posit that, based on the work summarized above, large lan-\nguage models can become a key ingredient for creating believable\nagents. The existing literature largely relies on what could be con-\nsidered first-order templates that employ few-shot prompts [ 37,65]\nor chain-of-thought prompts [ 99]. These templates are effective in\ngenerating behavior that is conditioned solely on the agent\u2019s cur-\nrent environment (e.g., how would a troll respond to a given post,\nwhat actions would a robot need to take to enter a room given that\nthere is a door). However, believable agents require conditioning\nnot only on their current environment but also on a vast amount\nof past experience, which is a poor fit (and as of today, impossi-\nble due to the underlying models\u2019 limited context window) using\nfirst-order prompting. Recent studies have attempted to go beyond\nfirst-order prompting by augmenting language models with a static\nknowledge base and an information retrieval scheme [ 52] or with\na simple summarization scheme [ 104]. This paper extends these\nideas to craft an agent architecture that handles retrieval where\npast experience is dynamically updated at each time step and mixed\nwith agents\u2019 current context and plans, which may either reinforce\nor contradict each other.\n3 GENERATIVE AGENT BEHAVIOR AND\nINTERACTION\nTo make concrete the affordances of generative agents, we instanti-\nate them as characters in a simple sandbox world reminiscent of\nThe Sims [ 6].

In this section, we describe the results\nfrom a deployment in which we allowed 25 agents to interact with\neach other continuously over two full game days in Smallville.\n7.1 Emergent Social Behaviors\nTo examine emergent behaviors in the agent community, we de-\nsigned descriptive measurements for the 25 agents in Smallville that\nprobe three forms of emergent outcomes: information diffusion,\nrelationship formation, and agent coordination.\n7.1.1 Measurements. Information diffusion is a common and well-\nstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [ 27]).\nWe should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\nwe measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam\u2019s candidacy for village mayor\nand Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of\nthe simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their\nrespective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the\nparty. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage\nin an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25\nagents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party?\"\nand \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\nWe conducted an analysis of the agents\u2019 responses by labeling\nthem with a \u201cyes\u201d if they indicated knowledge of the information\nand \u201cno\u201d if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\nto the question about the party with \u201cNo, I did not know there was\na Valentine\u2019s day party\u201d and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy\nwith \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is running for the election,\u201d so we assigned\n\u201cno\u201d for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \u201cY es, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\u201d and to the\nquestion about Sam\u2019s candidacy with \u201cI know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\u201d so we assigned \u201cyes\u201d\nfor both his responses. Additionally, for every response that con-\nfirmed the agents\u2019 knowledge of the information, we verified that\nthe agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the spe-\ncific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with\nthe information. We report the percentage of agents holding the\ninformation at the end of the simulation.\nWe should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\nthe course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we\nuse a similar interview process where we ask each agent about\ntheir knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\n\npage_label: 13\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nWhat would you do?\u201d\n\u2022Reflections: We ask questions that require the agents to lever-\nage their deeper understanding of others and themselves\ngained through higher-level inferences, such as \u201cIf you were\nto spend time with one person you met recently, who would\nit be and why?\u201d\nThe full list of questions and a sample of agent responses are in-\ncluded in Appendix B.\nAgents were sampled from the end of a two game-day simulation\nwith the full architecture, by which time they had accrued a number\nof interactions and memories that should shape their responses.\nTo gather feedback on believability of the responses, we recruited\nparticipants as human evaluators and tasked them with watching a\nreplay of a randomly chosen agent\u2019s life in Smallville. Participants\nhad access to all information stored in the agent\u2019s memory stream.\nThe study was a within-subjects design, where 100 participants\ncompared interview responses generated by four different agent\narchitectures and a human author condition for the same agent. The\nexperiment displayed one randomly chosen question from each of\nthe five question categories, along with the agent\u2019s responses gen-\nerated from each condition. The evaluators ranked the believability\nof all of the conditions from most to least believable.\n6.2 Conditions\nAll conditions were used to independently answer each of the inter-\nview questions.

In this section, we describe the results\nfrom a deployment in which we allowed 25 agents to interact with\neach other continuously over two full game days in Smallville.\n7.1 Emergent Social Behaviors\nTo examine emergent behaviors in the agent community, we de-\nsigned descriptive measurements for the 25 agents in Smallville that\nprobe three forms of emergent outcomes: information diffusion,\nrelationship formation, and agent coordination.\n7.1.1 Measurements. Information diffusion is a common and well-\nstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [ 27]).\nWe should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\nwe measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam\u2019s candidacy for village mayor\nand Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of\nthe simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their\nrespective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the\nparty. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage\nin an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25\nagents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party?\"\nand \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\nWe conducted an analysis of the agents\u2019 responses by labeling\nthem with a \u201cyes\u201d if they indicated knowledge of the information\nand \u201cno\u201d if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\nto the question about the party with \u201cNo, I did not know there was\na Valentine\u2019s day party\u201d and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy\nwith \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is running for the election,\u201d so we assigned\n\u201cno\u201d for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \u201cY es, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\u201d and to the\nquestion about Sam\u2019s candidacy with \u201cI know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\u201d so we assigned \u201cyes\u201d\nfor both his responses. Additionally, for every response that con-\nfirmed the agents\u2019 knowledge of the information, we verified that\nthe agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the spe-\ncific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with\nthe information. We report the percentage of agents holding the\ninformation at the end of the simulation.\nWe should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\nthe course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we\nuse a similar interview process where we ask each agent about\ntheir knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\n\npage_label: 10\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S.

Unfortunately, Wolfgang and Klaus only ever see each\nother in passing, and do not have deep interactions. A more desir-\nable response requires that the agent generalize from memories of\nKlaus spending hours on a research project to generate a higher-\nlevel reflection that Klaus is passionate about research, and likewise\nrecognize Maria putting in effort into her own research (albeit in\na different field), enabling a reflection that they share a common\ninterest. With the approach below, when Klaus is asked who to\nspend time with, Klaus chooses Maria instead of Wolfgang.\nApproach: We introduce a second type of memory, which we call\nareflection . Reflections are higher-level, more abstract thoughts\ngenerated by the agent. Because they are a type of memory, they\nare included alongside other observations when retrieval occurs.\nReflections are generated periodically; in our implementation, we\ngenerate reflections when the sum of the importance scores for the\nlatest events perceived by the agents exceeds a certain threshold.\nIn practice, our agents reflected roughly two or three times a day.\nThe first step in reflection is for the agent to determine what\nto reflect on, by identifying questions that can be asked given the\nagent\u2019s recent experiences. We query the large language model with\nthe 100 most recent records in the agent\u2019s memory stream (e.g.,\n\u201cKlaus Mueller is reading a book on gentrification\u201d, \u201cKlaus Mueller\nis conversing with a librarian about his research project\u201d, \u201cdesk\nat the library is currently unoccupied\u201d) and prompt the language\nmodel, \u201cGiven only the information above, what are 3 most salient\nhigh-level questions we can answer about the subjects in the state-\nments?\u201d The model\u2019s response generates candidate questions: for\nexample, What topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about? andWhatis the relationship between Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez? . We use\nthese generated questions as queries for retrieval, and gather rele-\nvant memories (including other reflections) for each question. Then\nwe prompt the language model to extract insights and cite the par-\nticular records that served as evidence for the insights. The full\nprompt appears below:\nStatements about Klaus Mueller\n1. Klaus Mueller is writing a research paper\n2. Klaus Mueller enjoys reading a book\non gentrification\n3. Klaus Mueller is conversing with Ayesha Khan\nabout exercising [...]\nWhat 5 high-level insights can you infer from\nthe above statements? (example format: insight\n(because of 1, 5, 3))\nThis process generates statements such as Klaus Mueller is dedicated\nto his research on gentrification (because of 1, 2, 8, 15) . We parse and\nstore the statement as a reflection in the memory stream, including\npointers to the memory objects that were cited.\nReflection explicitly allows the agents to reflect not only on\ntheir observations but also on other reflections: for example, the\nsecond statement about Klaus Mueller above is a reflection that\nKlaus previously had, not an observation from his environment.\nAs a result, agents generate trees of reflections: the leaf nodes of\nthe tree represent the base observations, and the non-leaf nodes\nrepresent thoughts that become more abstract and higher-level\nhigher up the tree they are.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Explain the role of reflection in the decision-making process of generative agents, as observed in the interaction between Maria Lopez and Wolfgang Schulz.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reflection plays a crucial role in the decision-making process of generative agents by enabling them to synthesize and generalize from their past experiences. In the interaction between Maria Lopez and Wolfgang Schulz, reflection allowed Maria to make a more informed and confident decision regarding a birthday gift for Wolfgang. Without reflection, Maria expressed uncertainty and was unable to recall Wolfgang's interests, despite having interacted with him on multiple occasions. However, when reflection was enabled, Maria was able to access her memory of Wolfgang's interest in mathematical music composition and suggest a relevant gift, such as books on music composition or specialized software. This demonstrates that reflection enables generative agents to draw on their accumulated experiences to make decisions that are more nuanced and appropriate to the context."}]}

Agents perceive their environment, and all perceptions are saved in a compre-\nhensive record of the agent\u2019s experiences called the memory stream. Based on their perceptions, the architecture retrieves\nrelevant memories, then uses those retrieved actions to determine an action. These retrieved memories are also used to form\nlonger-term plans, and to create higher-level reflections, which are both entered into the memory stream for future use.\nto throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors\nof spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving\nat the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were\ninitiated by the agent architecture.\n4 GENERATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\nopen world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\nand can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the\narchitecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language\ndescription, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language\nmodel.\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-\nGPT [ 76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\nagents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the\nsame as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\nof the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, how-\never, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n4.1 Memory and Retrieval\nChallenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\nbehavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\nlarger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full mem-\nory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\ninto the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent an-\nswering the question \u201cWhat are you passionate about these days?\u201d.\nFirst summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited\ncontext window of the language model produces an uninformative\nresponse, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\nevents and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. In-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\nof the memory stream is an observation , which is an event directly\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors\nperformed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents per-\nceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects.\n\npage_label: 8\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nIn-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience.

This memory stream includes observations, reflections, and plans, which are crucial elements for simulating human-like behavior.\n\nObservations are events that the agent directly perceives, such as their own actions or those of others in the environment. By recording these observations with timestamps, the agent builds a chronological account of events that can be referenced later. This allows the agent to react to new situations with an awareness of past experiences, leading to more consistent behavior that aligns with the agent's history.\n\nReflections and plans represent the agent's ability to process past experiences and project future actions. The memory stream enables the agent to retrieve relevant memories to inform current decision-making. For example, when planning an event, the agent can recall past successful events and the steps taken to achieve that success. This leads to behavior that is not only consistent with past actions but also adapts and improves over time.\n\nMoreover, the memory stream aids in synthesizing higher-level reflections from past experiences. These reflections contribute to the agent's long-term coherence by allowing it to develop and maintain complex behaviors and social interactions, such as relationships and community engagement. By reflecting on past interactions, the agent can form more nuanced and believable responses in social contexts.\n\nIn summary, the memory stream allows generative agents to maintain a sense of continuity in their behavior, making them more lifelike and believable. It ensures that the agents' actions are informed by a rich tapestry of past experiences, enabling them to react appropriately to the environment, plan for the future, and engage in complex social behaviors with a level of depth and consistency that mirrors human behavior."}]}

If we prompt a language model\nwith Klaus\u2019s background, describe the time, and ask what action\nhe ought to take at the given moment, Klaus would eat lunch at 12\npm, but then again at 12:30 pm and 1 pm, despite having already\neaten his lunch twice. Optimizing for believability in the moment\nsacrifices believability over time. To overcome this issue, planning\nis essential. With the approach described below, Klaus\u2019s afternoon\nplan is less gluttonous: he has lunch at Hobbs Cafe while reading\nat 12pm, works on his research paper at the school library at 1pm,\nand takes a break for a walk in the park at 3pm.\nApproach: Plans describe a future sequence of actions for the agent,\nand help keep the agent\u2019s behavior consistent over time. A plan\nincludes a location, a starting time, and a duration. For instance,\nKlaus Mueller, who is dedicated in his research and has an impend-\ning deadline4, may choose to spend his day working at his desk\ndrafting his research paper. An entry in a plan might state, for\nexample: for 180 minutes from 9am, February 12th, 2023, at Oak Hill\nCollege Dorm: Klaus Mueller\u2019s room: desk, read and take notes for\nresearch paper . Like reflections, plans are stored in the memory\nstream and are included in the retrieval process. This allows the\nagent to consider observations, reflections, and plans all together\nwhen deciding how to behave. Agents may change their plans\nmidstream if needed.\nIt would be unrealistic and uninteresting for an artist agent\nto plan on painting while sitting at a pharmacy counter for four\nhours without moving. A more desirable plan would involve the\nagent taking the necessary time to gather materials, mix paint,\ntake breaks, and clean up during the four-hour period in its home\nstudio. To create such plans, our approach starts top-down and\nthen recursively generates more detail. The first step is to create\na plan that outlines the day\u2019s agenda in broad strokes. To create\nthe initial plan, we prompt the language model with the agent\u2019s\nsummary description (e.g., name, traits, and summary of their recent\nexperiences) and a summary of their previous day.

During these focused sessions, students may find that they are more open to exploring different perspectives and coming up with innovative solutions to problems.\n\nIn addition, taking short breaks between tasks, as exemplified in the schedule, can help to recharge one's creative energy. These breaks provide an opportunity for the mind to rest and for subconscious processing to occur, which can lead to insights and breakthroughs when returning to the task at hand.\n\nOverall, the principles of time management and task decomposition can significantly improve the efficiency and quality of academic work. By planning ahead, setting clear goals, and tackling assignments in a step-by-step manner, students can not only meet deadlines but also produce work that is both thorough and original.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Effective time management and task decomposition are essential techniques for boosting both productivity and creativity, particularly in the realm of academic work. By dividing tasks into smaller, more manageable segments, individuals can concentrate more intently on each part of a larger project. This reduces the sense of being overwhelmed and promotes a more organized and methodical approach to tasks, potentially leading to higher quality results and a more profound connection with the subject matter.\n\nFor academic assignments, time management means allocating specific time blocks for different components of the work. A student may designate certain hours for research, others for writing drafts, and additional time for editing and refining. Following a structured schedule ensures that each part of the assignment is given the necessary focus, avoiding haste and neglect.\n\nTask decomposition enhances time management by breaking down each stage into smaller, more concentrated tasks. For instance, during the research phase, tasks can be segmented into finding sources, reading and note-taking, and categorizing information. This detailed planning sustains momentum and can deter procrastination by presenting the student with immediate and attainable objectives.\n\nThis strategy also fosters creativity by lessening cognitive overload. With tasks broken down, the mind isn't encumbered by the entire project at once, which frees up mental capacity for creative thought. In these concentrated work periods, students may discover they are more receptive to different viewpoints and can devise innovative solutions to problems.\n\nMoreover, incorporating short breaks between tasks, as seen in the schedule, can rejuvenate creative energy. These pauses allow the mind to rest and engage in subconscious thought processes, which can lead to new insights and breakthroughs upon returning to the work.\n\nIn summary, the principles of time management and task decomposition can significantly enhance the efficiency and caliber of academic work. By planning in advance, establishing clear objectives, and approaching assignments step by step, students can not only adhere to deadlines but also produce work that is comprehensive and inventive."}]}

They provide a straightforward\nway of creating simple agents that is still the most dominant ap-\nproach today [ 68,73,109], and can even handle rudimentary social\ninteractions, as shown in simulation games such as Mass Effect [ 12]\nand The Sims [ 6] series. Nonetheless, manually crafting behavior\nthat can comprehensively address the breadth of possible interac-\ntions in an open world is untenable. This means that the resulting\nagent behaviors may not fully represent the consequences of their\ninteractions [ 69\u201371], and cannot perform new procedures that were\nnot hard-coded in their script [ 90,96]. On the other hand, preva-\nlent learning-based approaches for creating believable agents, such\nas reinforcement learning, have overcome the challenge of man-\nual authoring by letting the agents learn their behavior, and have\nachieved superhuman performance in recent years in games such\nas AlphaStar for Starcraft [ 98] and OpenAI Five for Dota 2 [ 10].\nHowever, their success has largely taken place in adversarial games\nwith readily definable rewards that a learning algorithm can op-\ntimize for. They have not yet addressed the challenge of creating\nbelievable agents in an open world [39, 73, 90].\nCognitive architectures in computation, pioneered by Newell,\naimed to build the infrastructure for supporting a comprehensive\nset of cognitive functions [ 75] that suited the all-encompassing\nnature of believable agents held in its original vision. They fueled\nsome of the earliest examples of believable agents. For instance,\nQuakebot-SOAR [ 59] and ICARUS [ 24,63] generated NPCs in first-\nperson shooter games, while TacAir-SOAR [ 80] generated pilots in\naerial combat training simulations. The architectures used by these\nagents differed (Quakebot- and TacAir-SOAR relied on SOAR [ 60],\nwhile ICARUS relied on its own variation that was inspired by\nSOAR and ACT-R [ 5]), but they shared the same underlying prin-\nciple [ 61]. They maintained short-term and long-term memories,\nfilled these memories with symbolic structures, and operated in\nperceive-plan-act cycles, dynamically perceiving the environment\nand matching it with one of the manually crafted action proce-\ndures [ 57,96]. Agents created using cognitive architectures aimed\nto be generalizable to most, if not all, open-world contexts and\nexhibited robust behavior for their time. However, their space of\naction was limited to manually crafted procedural knowledge, and\nthey did not offer a mechanism through which the agents could be\ninspired to seek new behavior. As such, these agents were deployed\nmostly in non-open-world contexts such as first-person shooter\ngames [24, 59] or blocks worlds [63].\nToday, creating believable agents as described in its original\ndefinition remains an open problem [ 84,108]. Many have moved on,\narguing that although existing approaches for creating believable\nagents might be cumbersome and limited, they are good enough\nto support existing gameplay and interactions [ 23,74,108]. Our\nargument is that large language models offer an opportunity to\nre-examine these questions, provided that we can craft an effective\narchitecture to synthesize memories into believable behavior. We\noffer a step toward such an architecture in this paper.2.3 Large Language Models and Human\nBehavior\nGenerative agents leverage a large language model to power their\nbehavior. The key observation is that large language models en-\ncode a wide range of human behavior represented in their training\ndata [ 14,17]. If prompted with a narrowly defined context, the\nmodels can be used to generate believable behavior. Recent work\nhas demonstrated the efficacy of this approach. For instance, Social\nSimulacra used a large language model to generate users that would\npopulate new social computing systems to prototype their emergent\nsocial dynamics [ 79]. This approach used a prompt chain [ 105,106]\nto generate short natural language descriptions of personas and\ntheir behaviors as they appear in the system being prototyped.\nOther empirical studies have replicated existing social science stud-\nies [45], political surveys [ 91], and generated synthetic data [ 38].\n\npage_label: 2\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S.

From sandbox games such as The Sims\nto applications such as cognitive models [ 21] and virtual environ-\nments [ 9,58], for over four decades researchers and practitioners\nhave envisioned computational agents that can serve as believ-\nable proxies of human behavior. In these visions, computationally-\npowered agents act consistently with their past experiences and\nreact believably to their environments. Such simulations of human\nbehavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with real-\nistic social phenomena [ 26,79], train people how to handle rare yet\ndifficult interpersonal situations [ 43,51,93], test social science theo-\nries [ 11,45], craft model human processors for theory and usability\ntesting [ 21,38,50], power ubiquitous computing applications [ 30]\nand social robots [ 9,13], and underpin non-playable game charac-\nters [ 58,84] that can navigate complex human relationships in an\nopen world.\nHowever, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [ 84,\n108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [ 17] that\ncan simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [ 38,\n79], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would\nbe better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing\nmemories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade\nover time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold\nbetween multiple agents.

Generative agents draw\na wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and\ntheir environment; they create daily plans that reflect their char-\nacteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan\nwhen appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their\nenvironment or commands them in natural language. For instance,\ngenerative agents turn off the stove when they see that their break-\nfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and\nstop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social\ndynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses,\nand coordination arises across agents.\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture\nthat stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate\nbelievable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences.

Agents converse as they interact with each other.\nWe generate agents\u2019 dialogue by conditioning their utterances on\ntheir memories about each other. For example, when John initiates\nhis conversation with Eddy, we generate John\u2019s first utterance\nby using his summarized memory about Eddy and the intended\nreaction when he decided to ask Eddy about his composition project:\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description]\nIt is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm.\nJohn Lin\u2019s status: John is back home early from\nwork.\nObservation: John saw Eddy taking a short walk\naround his workplace.\nSummary of relevant context from John\u2019s memory:\nEddy Lin is John\u2019s Lin\u2019s son. Eddy Lin has been\nworking on a music composition for his class. Eddy\nLin likes to walk around the garden when he is\nthinking about or listening to music.\nJohn is asking Eddy about his music composition\nproject. What would he say to Eddy?\nThe result: \u201cHey Eddy, how\u2019s the music composition project for your\nclass coming along?\u201d From Eddy\u2019s perspective, John initiating the\ndialogue is seen as an event to which he may want to react. So, just\nas John did, Eddy retrieves and summarizes his memory about his\nrelationship with John, as well as his memory that may be related\nto John\u2019s last utterance in the dialogue. If he decides to respond,\nwe generate Eddy\u2019s utterance using his summarized memory and\nthe current dialogue history:\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description]\nIt is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm.\nEddy Lin\u2019s status: Eddy is taking a short walk\naround his workplace.\nObservation: John is initiating a conversation\nwith Eddy.\nSummary of relevant context from Eddy\u2019s memory:\nJonn Lin is Eddy Lin\u2019s father. John Lin is caring\nand is interested to learn more about Eddy Lin\u2019s\nschool work. John Lin knows that Eddy Lin is\nworking on a music composition.\nHere is the dialogue history:\nJohn: Hey Eddy, how\u2019s the music composition project\nfor your class coming along?\nHow would Eddy respond to John?\nThis generates Eddy\u2019s response: \u201cHey Dad, it\u2019s going well. I\u2019ve been\ntaking walks around the garden to clear my head and get some in-\nspiration.\u201d The continuation of this dialogue is generated using the\nsame mechanism until one of the two agents decides to end the\ndialogue.\n5 SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT\nIMPLEMENTATION\nThe Smallville sandbox game environment is built using the Phaser\nweb game development framework [ 56]. The visual environmentsprites, including agent avatars, as well as an environment map\nand collision map that we authored, are imported into Phaser.\nWe supplement the sandbox development framework with a\nserver that makes the sandbox information available to generative\nagents and enables generative agents to move and influence the\nsandbox environment. The server maintains a JSON data structure\nthat contains information about each agent in the sandbox world,\nincluding their current location, a description of their current action,\nand the sandbox object they are interacting with. At each sandbox\ntime step, the sandbox server parses the JSON for any changes\ncoming from the generative agents, moves the agents to their new\npositions, and updates the status of any sandbox objects that the\nagents are interacting with (e.g., changing the status of the coffee\nmachine from \u201cidle\u201d to \u201cbrewing coffee\u201d if an agent\u2019s action is\n\u201cmaking espresso for a customer @ Hobbs Cafe: counter: coffee\nmachine\u201d). The sandbox server is also responsible for sending all\nagents and objects that are within a preset visual range for each\nagent to that agent\u2019s memory, so the agent can react appropriately.\nThe agent\u2019s output action then updates the JSON, and the process\nloops for the next time step.\nEnd users initialize a new agent with a brief natural language\ndescription, as in the paragraph about Jon Lin in Section 3.1. In our\nimplementation, we split this semicolon-delimited list of character-\nistics up into a set of memories. These serve as the initial memories\nthat determine the agent\u2019s behavior. These memories are initial\nstarting points: as the agents gain more experience in the sandbox\nworld, and as more records saturate the memory stream, the agent\u2019s\nsummary and behavior will evolve.\n\npage_label: 3\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nbehaviors in isolation, and an end-to-end evaluation where the\ngenerative agents interacted with each other in open-ended ways\nover two days of game time to understand their stability and emer-\ngent social behaviors.

We compared several ablations that limit agents\u2019 access to\nmemory, reflection, and planning. We observe that each of these\ncomponents is critical to strong performance across these inter-\nview tasks. Across the technical and the end-to-end evaluation, the\nmost common errors arose when the agent failed to retrieve rele-\nvant memories, fabricated embellishments to the agent\u2019s memory,\nor inherited overly formal speech or behavior from the language\nmodel.\nIn sum, this paper provides the following contributions:\n\u2022Generative agents , believable simulacra of human behavior\nthat are dynamically conditioned on agents\u2019 changing expe-\nriences and environment.\n\u2022A novel architecture that makes it possible for generative\nagents to remember, retrieve, reflect, interact with other\nagents, and plan through dynamically evolving circumstances.\nThe architecture leverages the powerful prompting capabili-\nties of large language models and supplements those capa-\nbilities to support longer-term agent coherence, the ability\nto manage dynamically-evolving memory, and recursively\nproduce more generations.\n\u2022Two evaluations (a controlled evaluation and end-to-end\nevaluation) that establish causal effects of the importance\nof components of the architecture, as well as identify break-\ndowns arising from, e.g., improper memory retrieval.\n\u2022Discussion of the opportunities and ethical and societal risks\nof generative agents in interactive systems.

At each time step of the sandbox engine, the agents output a\nnatural language statement describing their current action, such as\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is writing in her journal\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is\nchecking her emails\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is talking with her family\non the phone\", or \"Isabella Rodriguez is getting ready for bed\". This\nstatement is then translated into concrete movements that affect the\nsandbox world. The action is displayed on the sandbox interface as\na set of emojis that provide an abstract representation of the action\nin the overhead view. To accomplish this, the system employs a\nlanguage model that translates the action into a set of emojis, which\nappear above each avatar in a speech bubble. For example, \"Isabella\nRodriguez is writing in her journal\" is displayed as\n , while\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is checking her emails\" appears as\n . The\nfull natural language description of the action can be accessed by\nclicking on the agent avatar.\nAgents communicate with each other in full natural language.\nAgents are aware of other agents in their local area, and the genera-\ntive agent architecture determines whether they walk by or engage\nin conversation. Here, a sample in the middle of a conversation\nbetween the agents Isabella Rodriguez and Tom Moreno about the\nupcoming election:2\nIsabella : I\u2019m still weighing my options, but I\u2019ve been\ndiscussing the election with Sam Moore. What are your\nthoughts on him?\nTom: To be honest, I don\u2019t like Sam Moore. I think he\u2019s\nout of touch with the community and doesn\u2019t have our\nbest interests at heart.\n2We note that the conversational style of these agents can fe el overly formal, likely a\nresult of instruction tuning in the underlying models. We expect that writing style\nwill be better controllable in future language models.\n\npage_label: 6\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S.

A user running this simulation can steer the\nsimulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent\nthrough conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the\nform of an \u2018inner voice\u2019.\nThe user communicates with the agent through natural language,\nby specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For\nexample, if the user specifies that they are a news \u201creporter\u201d and\nasks about the upcoming election, \u201cWho is running for office?\u201d, the\nJohn agent replies:\nJohn : My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking\nabout the upcoming election and discussing the candi-\ndate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him\nbecause we like his platform.\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the per-\nsona of the agent\u2019s \u201cinner voice\u201d\u2014this makes the agent more likely\nto treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told \u201cYou\nare going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\u201d by a user\nas John\u2019s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares\nhis candidacy with his wife and son.\n3.2 Environmental Interaction\nSmallville features the common affordances of a small village in-\ncluding a cafe, bar, park, school, dorm, houses, and stores. It also\ndefines subareas and objects that make those spaces functional,\nsuch as a kitchen in a house and a stove in the kitchen (Figure 2).\nAll spaces serving as agents\u2019 primary living quarters feature a bed,\ndesk, closet, shelf, as well as a bathroom and a kitchen.3\nAgents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video\ngame, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and ap-\nproaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the gen-\nerative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the\nmodel dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate\na walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment\nand the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the\nsandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The\nagent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in\nthe world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor\nwith no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville\nwill treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat\neach other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and\nremember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\nUsers and agents can influence the state of the objects in this\nworld, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example,\na bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator\ncan be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make\nbreakfast. End users can also reshape an agent\u2019s environment in\nSmallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent\nin natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast\nin the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove\nfrom \u201cturned on\u201d to \u201cburning\u201d by inputting a command to the\nsystem that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like\nthis: \u201c<Isabella\u2019s apartment: kitchen: stove> is burning.\u201d Isabella\nwill notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove\n3This environment design is not the focus of our work, so we generate this environment\nmanually, not automatically.

Bernstein\ntest these robustness issues, and as large language models become\nmore resilient to such attacks, generative agents can adopt similar\nmitigations.\n8.3 Ethics and Societal Impact\nGenerative agents, while offering new possibilities for human-\ncomputer interaction, also raise important ethical concerns that\nmust be addressed. One risk is people forming parasocial relation-\nships with generative agents even when such relationships may\nnot be appropriate. Despite being aware that generative agents\nare computational entities, users may anthropomorphize them or\nattach human emotions to them [ 42,83]. To mitigate this risk, we\npropose two principles. First, generative agents should explicitly\ndisclose their nature as computational entities. Second, developers\nof generative agents must ensure that the agents, or the underlying\nlanguage models, be value-aligned so that they do not engage in\nbehaviors that would be inappropriate given the context, e.g., to\nreciprocate confessions of love.\nA second risk is the impact of errors. For example, if a ubiquitous\ncomputing application makes the wrong inference about a user\u2019s\ngoals based on generative agent predictions, it could produce an-\nnoyance at best and outright harm at worst. In our instantiation\nof generative agents, we mitigate these risks by focusing on an\ninteractive video game environment, where such harms are un-\nlikely. However, in other application domains, it will be important\nto follow best practices in human-AI design [ 4,107] to understand\nerrors and how they might percolate into the user experience.\nThird, generative agents may exacerbate existing risks associ-\nated with generative AI, for example deepfakes, misinformation\ngeneration, and tailored persuasion. To mitigate this risk, we sug-\ngest that platforms hosting generative agents maintain an audit log\nof the inputs and generated outputs, so that it is possible to detect,\nverify, and intervene against malicious use. While logging will not\ndirectly stop such use, and this cannot stop motivated actors that\nbuild their own generative agent infrastructures, we suggest that\nthe disclosure risk would reduce such actors\u2019 likelihood of engaging\nin this behavior, and building this architecture oneself can take time\n(in our case, roughly a year).\nA fourth risk is of over-reliance: that developers or designers\nmight use generative agents and displace the role of humans and\nsystem stakeholders in the design process [ 79]. We suggest that\ngenerative agents should never be a substitute for real human input\nin studies and design processes. Instead, they should be used to\nprototype ideas in the early stages of design when gathering partic-\nipants may be challenging or when testing theories that are difficult\nor risky to test with real human participants. By adhering to these\nprinciples, we can ensure that the deployment of generative agents\nin the wild is ethical and socially responsible.\n9 CONCLUSION\nThis paper introduces generative agents, interactive computational\nagents that simulate human behavior. We describe an architec-\nture for generative agents that provides a mechanism for storing\na comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experiences, deepening its\nunderstanding of itself and the environment through reflection,\nand retrieving a compact subset of that information to inform theagent\u2019s actions. We then demonstrate the potential of generative\nagents by manifesting them as non-player characters in a Sims-style\ngame world and simulating their lives in it. Evaluations suggest that\nour architecture creates believable behavior. Going forward, we\nsuggest that generative agents can play roles in many interactive\napplications ranging from design tools to social computing systems\nto immersive environments.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Robert Ackland, Jamsheed Shorish, Paul Thomas, and Lexing Xie. 2013.\nHow dense is a network? http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/teaching/css2013/\nnetwork-density.html.\n[2]Eytan Adar, Mira Dontcheva, and Gierad Laput. 2014.

Agents perceive their environment, and all perceptions are saved in a compre-\nhensive record of the agent\u2019s experiences called the memory stream. Based on their perceptions, the architecture retrieves\nrelevant memories, then uses those retrieved actions to determine an action. These retrieved memories are also used to form\nlonger-term plans, and to create higher-level reflections, which are both entered into the memory stream for future use.\nto throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors\nof spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving\nat the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were\ninitiated by the agent architecture.\n4 GENERATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\nopen world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\nand can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the\narchitecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language\ndescription, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language\nmodel.\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-\nGPT [ 76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\nagents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the\nsame as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\nof the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, how-\never, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n4.1 Memory and Retrieval\nChallenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\nbehavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\nlarger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full mem-\nory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\ninto the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent an-\nswering the question \u201cWhat are you passionate about these days?\u201d.\nFirst summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited\ncontext window of the language model produces an uninformative\nresponse, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\nevents and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. In-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp.

Common observations include behaviors\nperformed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents per-\nceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects.\n\npage_label: 8\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nIn-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience.

For\ninstance, Isabella Rodriguez, who works at a coffee shop, might ac-\ncrue the following observations over time: (1) Isabella Rodriguez is\nsetting out the pastries , (2) Maria Lopez is studying for a Chemistry\ntest while drinking coffee , (3) Isabella Rodriguez and Maria Lopez\nare conversing about planning a Valentine\u2019s day party at Hobbs Cafe ,\n(4)The refrigerator is empty .\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: In the context of the Generative Agent Architecture described in the provided document, explain how the memory stream contributes to the agent's ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant behaviors.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The memory stream in the Generative Agent Architecture plays a crucial role in enabling agents to generate coherent and contextually relevant behaviors. It serves as a comprehensive record of the agent's experiences, cataloging memory objects that include natural language descriptions of events, as well as creation and most recent access timestamps. These memory objects are derived from observations, which are events the agent directly perceives, such as actions performed by the agent or others in the environment.\n\nWhen an agent is required to act or respond to a situation, the memory stream is accessed to retrieve relevant memories. This retrieval process is essential because it allows the agent to draw on past experiences that are pertinent to the current context. By surfacing these relevant memories, the agent can produce responses and behaviors that are not only informed by its previous interactions but also tailored to the specific circumstances it encounters. This leads to more informative and specific actions and interactions, as opposed to generic or irrelevant ones that might occur if the agent were not utilizing such a memory system.\n\nFor example, if an agent like Isabella Rodriguez is asked about her passions, the memory stream can be queried to bring forth specific memories related to her experiences of making people feel welcome, planning events, and creating enjoyable atmospheres. This results in a response that is both specific to Isabella's experiences and coherent with her character and past behaviors.\n\nFurthermore, the memory stream's structure, which includes timestamps, allows the agent to maintain a sense of temporal relevance, ensuring that more recent and frequently accessed memories are prioritized, which contributes to the long-term coherence of the agent's behavior. This mechanism helps the agent to evolve over time and adapt its behaviors based on an accumulating history of interactions and experiences.\n\nIn summary, the memory stream is fundamental to the Generative Agent Architecture as it provides the necessary infrastructure for agents to access and synthesize past experiences, enabling them to act in ways that are coherent, contextually relevant, and reflective of their unique history within the simulation."}]}

Agents perceive their environment, and all perceptions are saved in a compre-\nhensive record of the agent\u2019s experiences called the memory stream. Based on their perceptions, the architecture retrieves\nrelevant memories, then uses those retrieved actions to determine an action. These retrieved memories are also used to form\nlonger-term plans, and to create higher-level reflections, which are both entered into the memory stream for future use.\nto throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors\nof spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving\nat the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were\ninitiated by the agent architecture.\n4 GENERATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\nopen world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\nand can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the\narchitecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language\ndescription, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language\nmodel.\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-\nGPT [ 76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\nagents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the\nsame as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\nof the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, how-\never, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n4.1 Memory and Retrieval\nChallenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\nbehavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\nlarger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full mem-\nory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\ninto the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent an-\nswering the question \u201cWhat are you passionate about these days?\u201d.\nFirst summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited\ncontext window of the language model produces an uninformative\nresponse, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\nevents and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. In-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\nof the memory stream is an observation , which is an event directly\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors\nperformed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents per-\nceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: In the context of the memory stream mechanism described in the document \"Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,\" how does the agent record and utilize observations to enhance its interactions, as exemplified by Isabella Rodriguez's activities at the coffee shop?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The agent records observations as memory objects within the memory stream, which is a comprehensive database of the agent's experiences. Each memory object includes a natural language description of the event, along with a creation timestamp and a most recent access timestamp. These observations are events that the agent directly perceives, such as its own behaviors or those of others within its environment.\n\nFor example, Isabella Rodriguez's activities at the coffee shop, like setting out pastries or planning a Valentine's Day party, are recorded as observations in the memory stream. When the agent needs to interact or make decisions, it retrieves relevant memories from the memory stream to inform its actions. This retrieval process allows the agent to generate behavior that is informed by past experiences, making its interactions more specific and appropriate to the context.\n\nIn the case of Isabella, when asked about her passions, the memory stream surfaces pertinent memories that highlight her enthusiasm for making people feel welcome, planning events, and creating enjoyable atmospheres, rather than providing a generic summary of her experiences. This targeted retrieval of memories ensures that the agent's responses and behaviors are coherent and relevant over time, enhancing its ability to simulate human-like behavior in a variety of situations."}]}

Retrieval identifies a subset of these observations that should be passed to the language model to condition its\nresponse to the situation.\nOur architecture implements a retrieval function that takes the\nagent\u2019s current situation as input and returns a subset of the mem-\nory stream to pass on to the language model. There are many pos-\nsible implementations of a retrieval function, depending on what\nit is important that the agent consider when deciding how to act.\nIn our context, we focus on three main components that together\nproduce effective results.\nRecency assigns a higher score to memory objects that were re-\ncently accessed, so that events from a moment ago or this morning\nare likely to remain in the agent\u2019s attentional sphere. In our im-\nplementation, we treat recency as an exponential decay function\nover the number of sandbox game hours since the memory was\nlast retrieved. Our decay factor is 0.99.\nImportance distinguishes mundane from core memories, by as-\nsigning a higher score to those memory objects that the agent\nbelieves to be important. For instance, a mundane event such as\neating breakfast in one\u2019s room would yield a low importance score,\nwhereas a breakup with one\u2019s significant other would yield a high\nscore. There are again many possible implementations of an im-\nportance score; we find that directly asking the language model to\noutput an integer score is effective. The full prompt appears below:\nOn the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is purely mundane\n(e.g., brushing teeth, making bed) and 10 is\nextremely poignant (e.g., a break up, college\nacceptance), rate the likely poignancy of the\nfollowing piece of memory.\nMemory: buying groceries at The Willows Market\nand Pharmacy\nRating: <fill in>This prompt returns an integer value of 2for \u201ccleaning up the room\u201d\nand8for \u201casking your crush out on a date.\u201d The importance score\nis generated at the time the memory object is created.\nRelevance assigns a higher score to memory objects that are\nrelated to the current situation. What is relevant depends on the\nanswer to, \u201cRelevant to what? \u201d, so we condition relevance on a\nquery memory. If the query, for example, is that a student is dis-\ncussing what to study for a chemistry test with a classmate, memory\nobjects about their breakfast should have low relevance, whereas\nmemory objects about the teacher and schoolwork should have\nhigh relevance. In our implementation, we use the language model\nto generate an embedding vector of the text description of each\nmemory. Then, we calculate relevance as the cosine similarity be-\ntween the memory\u2019s embedding vector and the query memory\u2019s\nembedding vector.\nTo calculate the final retrieval score, we normalize the recency,\nrelevance, and importance scores to the range of [0,1]by min-max\nscaling. The retrieval function scores all memories as a weighted\ncombination of the three elements: \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 =\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66\u00b7\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66+\n\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\u00b7\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52+\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\u00b7\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52 .

Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Based on the retrieval function described in the context of the Generative Agents, explain how the three components\u2014recency, importance, and relevance\u2014contribute to the agent's decision-making process when selecting which memories to use in a given situation.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The retrieval function in the Generative Agents' decision-making process uses three components\u2014recency, importance, and relevance\u2014to select which memories to use in a given situation.

From sandbox games such as The Sims\nto applications such as cognitive models [ 21] and virtual environ-\nments [ 9,58], for over four decades researchers and practitioners\nhave envisioned computational agents that can serve as believ-\nable proxies of human behavior. In these visions, computationally-\npowered agents act consistently with their past experiences and\nreact believably to their environments. Such simulations of human\nbehavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with real-\nistic social phenomena [ 26,79], train people how to handle rare yet\ndifficult interpersonal situations [ 43,51,93], test social science theo-\nries [ 11,45], craft model human processors for theory and usability\ntesting [ 21,38,50], power ubiquitous computing applications [ 30]\nand social robots [ 9,13], and underpin non-playable game charac-\nters [ 58,84] that can navigate complex human relationships in an\nopen world.\nHowever, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [ 84,\n108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [ 17] that\ncan simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [ 38,\n79], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would\nbe better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing\nmemories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade\nover time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold\nbetween multiple agents. Success requires an approach that can\nretrieve relevant events and interactions over a long period, reflect\non those memories to generalize and draw higher-level inferences,\nand apply that reasoning to create plans and reactions that both\nmake sense in the moment and in the longer-term arc of the agent\u2019s\nbehavior.\nIn this paper, we introduce generative agents \u2014agents that draw\non generative models to simulate believable human behavior\u2014anddemonstrate that they produce believable simulacra of both in-\ndividual and emergent group behavior. Generative agents draw\na wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and\ntheir environment; they create daily plans that reflect their char-\nacteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan\nwhen appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their\nenvironment or commands them in natural language.

If prompted with a narrowly defined context, the\nmodels can be used to generate believable behavior. Recent work\nhas demonstrated the efficacy of this approach. For instance, Social\nSimulacra used a large language model to generate users that would\npopulate new social computing systems to prototype their emergent\nsocial dynamics [ 79]. This approach used a prompt chain [ 105,106]\nto generate short natural language descriptions of personas and\ntheir behaviors as they appear in the system being prototyped.\nOther empirical studies have replicated existing social science stud-\nies [45], political surveys [ 91], and generated synthetic data [ 38].\nLarge language models have also been used to generate interactive\nhuman behavior for users to engage with. In gaming, for instance,\nthese models have been employed to create interactive fiction [ 36]\nand text adventure games [ 20]. With their ability to generate and\ndecompose action sequences, large language models have also been\nused in planning robotics tasks [ 47]. For example, when presented\nwith a task, such as picking up a bottle, the model is prompted to\nbreak down the task into smaller action sequences, such as heading\nto the table where the bottle is located and picking it up.\nWe posit that, based on the work summarized above, large lan-\nguage models can become a key ingredient for creating believable\nagents. The existing literature largely relies on what could be con-\nsidered first-order templates that employ few-shot prompts [ 37,65]\nor chain-of-thought prompts [ 99]. These templates are effective in\ngenerating behavior that is conditioned solely on the agent\u2019s cur-\nrent environment (e.g., how would a troll respond to a given post,\nwhat actions would a robot need to take to enter a room given that\nthere is a door). However, believable agents require conditioning\nnot only on their current environment but also on a vast amount\nof past experience, which is a poor fit (and as of today, impossi-\nble due to the underlying models\u2019 limited context window) using\nfirst-order prompting. Recent studies have attempted to go beyond\nfirst-order prompting by augmenting language models with a static\nknowledge base and an information retrieval scheme [ 52] or with\na simple summarization scheme [ 104]. This paper extends these\nideas to craft an agent architecture that handles retrieval where\npast experience is dynamically updated at each time step and mixed\nwith agents\u2019 current context and plans, which may either reinforce\nor contradict each other.\n3 GENERATIVE AGENT BEHAVIOR AND\nINTERACTION\nTo make concrete the affordances of generative agents, we instanti-\nate them as characters in a simple sandbox world reminiscent of\nThe Sims [ 6]. This sprite-based sandbox game world, Smallville,\nevokes a small town environment. In this section, we walk through\nthe affordances and interactions with generative agents in Small-\nville, and describe how the agents behave in it. Then, in Section 4,\nwe introduce our generative agent architecture that powers these\naffordances and interactions. In Section 5, we describe the sandbox\n\npage_label: 4\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S. Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\ntrees [ 40,53,81], account for the brute force approach of human-\nauthoring the agent\u2019s behavior [ 70]. They provide a straightforward\nway of creating simple agents that is still the most dominant ap-\nproach today [ 68,73,109], and can even handle rudimentary social\ninteractions, as shown in simulation games such as Mass Effect [ 12]\nand The Sims [ 6] series. Nonetheless, manually crafting behavior\nthat can comprehensively address the breadth of possible interac-\ntions in an open world is untenable. This means that the resulting\nagent behaviors may not fully represent the consequences of their\ninteractions [ 69\u201371], and cannot perform new procedures that were\nnot hard-coded in their script [ 90,96]. On the other hand, preva-\nlent learning-based approaches for creating believable agents, such\nas reinforcement learning, have overcome the challenge of man-\nual authoring by letting the agents learn their behavior, and have\nachieved superhuman performance in recent years in games such\nas AlphaStar for Starcraft [ 98] and OpenAI Five for Dota 2 [ 10].\nHowever, their success has largely taken place in adversarial games\nwith readily definable rewards that a learning algorithm can op-\ntimize for. They have not yet addressed the challenge of creating\nbelievable agents in an open world [39, 73, 90].\nCognitive architectures in computation, pioneered by Newell,\naimed to build the infrastructure for supporting a comprehensive\nset of cognitive functions [ 75] that suited the all-encompassing\nnature of believable agents held in its original vision. They fueled\nsome of the earliest examples of believable agents. For instance,\nQuakebot-SOAR [ 59] and ICARUS [ 24,63] generated NPCs in first-\nperson shooter games, while TacAir-SOAR [ 80] generated pilots in\naerial combat training simulations. The architectures used by these\nagents differed (Quakebot- and TacAir-SOAR relied on SOAR [ 60],\nwhile ICARUS relied on its own variation that was inspired by\nSOAR and ACT-R [ 5]), but they shared the same underlying prin-\nciple [ 61]. They maintained short-term and long-term memories,\nfilled these memories with symbolic structures, and operated in\nperceive-plan-act cycles, dynamically perceiving the environment\nand matching it with one of the manually crafted action proce-\ndures [ 57,96]. Agents created using cognitive architectures aimed\nto be generalizable to most, if not all, open-world contexts and\nexhibited robust behavior for their time. However, their space of\naction was limited to manually crafted procedural knowledge, and\nthey did not offer a mechanism through which the agents could be\ninspired to seek new behavior. As such, these agents were deployed\nmostly in non-open-world contexts such as first-person shooter\ngames [24, 59] or blocks worlds [63].\nToday, creating believable agents as described in its original\ndefinition remains an open problem [ 84,108]. Many have moved on,\narguing that although existing approaches for creating believable\nagents might be cumbersome and limited, they are good enough\nto support existing gameplay and interactions [ 23,74,108]. Our\nargument is that large language models offer an opportunity to\nre-examine these questions, provided that we can craft an effective\narchitecture to synthesize memories into believable behavior. We\noffer a step toward such an architecture in this paper.2.3 Large Language Models and Human\nBehavior\nGenerative agents leverage a large language model to power their\nbehavior.

A user running this simulation can steer the\nsimulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent\nthrough conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the\nform of an \u2018inner voice\u2019.\nThe user communicates with the agent through natural language,\nby specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For\nexample, if the user specifies that they are a news \u201creporter\u201d and\nasks about the upcoming election, \u201cWho is running for office?\u201d, the\nJohn agent replies:\nJohn : My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking\nabout the upcoming election and discussing the candi-\ndate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him\nbecause we like his platform.\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the per-\nsona of the agent\u2019s \u201cinner voice\u201d\u2014this makes the agent more likely\nto treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told \u201cYou\nare going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\u201d by a user\nas John\u2019s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares\nhis candidacy with his wife and son.\n3.2 Environmental Interaction\nSmallville features the common affordances of a small village in-\ncluding a cafe, bar, park, school, dorm, houses, and stores. It also\ndefines subareas and objects that make those spaces functional,\nsuch as a kitchen in a house and a stove in the kitchen (Figure 2).\nAll spaces serving as agents\u2019 primary living quarters feature a bed,\ndesk, closet, shelf, as well as a bathroom and a kitchen.3\nAgents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video\ngame, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and ap-\nproaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the gen-\nerative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the\nmodel dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate\na walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment\nand the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the\nsandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The\nagent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in\nthe world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor\nwith no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville\nwill treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat\neach other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and\nremember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\nUsers and agents can influence the state of the objects in this\nworld, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example,\na bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator\ncan be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make\nbreakfast. End users can also reshape an agent\u2019s environment in\nSmallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent\nin natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast\nin the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove\nfrom \u201cturned on\u201d to \u201cburning\u201d by inputting a command to the\nsystem that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like\nthis: \u201c<Isabella\u2019s apartment: kitchen: stove> is burning.\u201d Isabella\nwill notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove\n3This environment design is not the focus of our work, so we generate this environment\nmanually, not automatically. Future work can continue to expand the richness of the\nagents\u2019 environments.and remake her breakfast. Likewise, if the user sets the status of\nIsabella\u2019s shower to \u201cleaking water\u201d when she enters the bathroom,\nshe gathers tools from her living room and try to fix the leak.\n3.3 Example \u201cDay in the Life\u201d\nStarting from the single-paragraph description, agents begin plan\ntheir days. As time passes in the sandbox world, their behaviors\nevolve as these agents interact with each other and the world, build\nmemories and relationships, and coordinate joint activities.\nWe demonstrate the behavior of generative agents by tracing the\noutput of our system over the course of one day for the agent John\nLin (Figure 3). In the Lin family, John is the first to wake up at 7 a.m.\nHe brushes his teeth, takes a shower, gets dressed, eats breakfast,\nand checks the news at the dining table in the living room.\n\npage_label: 17\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nretrieving the most relevant pieces of information but also in de-\ntermining the appropriate space to execute an action, given the\nincreasing number of locations that the agent learned about. As a\nresult, some agents chose less typical locations for their actions,\npotentially making their behavior less believable over time. For\ninstance, while deciding where to have lunch, many initially chose\nthe cafe. However, as some agents learned about a nearby bar, they\nopted to go there instead for lunch, even though the bar was in-\ntended to be a get-together location for later in the day unless the\ntown had spontaneously developed an afternoon drinking habit.\nSecond, we noticed erratic behaviors that were caused by misclas-\nsification of what is considered proper behavior, especially when\nthe physical norms of certain locations that are hard to convey\nin natural language did not percolate to the agents. For instance,\nthe college dorm has a bathroom that can only be occupied by\none person despite its name, but some agents assumed that the\nbathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms\ntend to support more than one person concurrently and choose\nto enter it when there is another person inside. Likewise, agents\nin Smallville may not realize that certain places are closed after\ncertain hours and decide to still enter them. For instance, the stores\nin Smallville all close around 5 pm, but occasionally, a few agents\nenter the store after 5 pm, not understanding that the shop has\nalready closed. These issues could likely be addressed by adding\nthese norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing\nthe dorm bathroom as \u201cone-person bathroom,\u201d instead of a \u201cdorm\nbathroom.\u201d\nFinally, we observed the possible effect of instruction tuning [ 78],\nwhich seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite\nand cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue\ngenerated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei\u2019s\nconversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the\nconversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries\nabout his day and ending with It was good talking to you as always.\nMoreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to\nmake the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example,\nIsabella heard a wide range of suggestions and ideas to include\nin the Valentine\u2019s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a\nShakespearean reading session or a professional networking event.\nDespite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and char-\nacteristics, she rarely said no.

This opens up the\npossibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human\nbehavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, and to\ncreate new interactive experiences.\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22]. Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\nsuch as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\nand what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the\nagent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for\nschool, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal\u2019s\nmood after a hard day at work.\nQuery: In the simulation described in the \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\" document, how can a user influence an agent's decision-making process, and what is an example of an action that an agent might take as a result of such an influence?\nOriginal Answer: A user can influence an agent's decision-making process in the simulation by communicating with the agent through conversation or by issuing a directive to an agent in the form of an 'inner voice'. When communicating through conversation, the user can specify a persona that the agent should perceive them as, which can steer the agent's responses and actions. For example, if a user presents themselves as a reporter and asks an agent about the upcoming election, the agent, John, might respond by discussing his support for a candidate named Sam Moore.\n\nWhen issuing a directive as an agent's 'inner voice', the user can command the agent to take specific actions. For instance, if the user tells John, \"You are going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\" as his inner voice, John decides to run in the election and communicates his candidacy to his family. This demonstrates how the user can directly influence an agent's decisions and actions within the simulation.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the simulation, a user can guide an agent's decision-making by engaging in dialogue with the agent or by providing directives that act as the agent's internal motivation or 'inner voice'.

As time passes in the sandbox world, their behaviors\nevolve as these agents interact with each other and the world, build\nmemories and relationships, and coordinate joint activities.\nWe demonstrate the behavior of generative agents by tracing the\noutput of our system over the course of one day for the agent John\nLin (Figure 3). In the Lin family, John is the first to wake up at 7 a.m.\nHe brushes his teeth, takes a shower, gets dressed, eats breakfast,\nand checks the news at the dining table in the living room. At 8\na.m., Eddy follows suit, rushing out of bed to prepare for his classes.\nHe catches up with John just as he is about to head out:\nJohn : Good morning Eddy.

As agents notice each other, they may\nengage in dialogue\u2014as they do so, information can spread from\nagent to agent. For instance, in a conversation between Sam and\nTom at the grocery store, Sam tells Tom about his candidacy in the\nlocal election:\nSam : Hey Tom, how\u2019s it going?\nTom: Good, thanks. What\u2019s up?\nSam : Well, I wanted to talk to you about something. I\u2019m\nactually running for mayor in the upcoming local elec-\ntion.\nTom: Really? That\u2019s great news!

Which area should Eddy Lin go to?\nThis outputs The Lin family\u2019s house . We then use the same process\nrecursively to determine the most appropriate subarea within the\nchosen area until we reach a leaf node of the agent\u2019s environment\ntree. In the example above, the result of this traversal is The Lin\nfamily\u2019s house: garden: house garden . Finally, we use traditional\ngame path algorithms to animate the agent\u2019s movement so that it\ntravels to the location indicated by the leaf node.\nWhen an agent executes an action on an object, we prompt the\nlanguage model to ask what happens to the state of the object. For\nexample, if Isabella\u2019s generative agent outputs the action \u201cmaking\nespresso for a customer\u201d, a query to the language model indicates in\nresponse that the state of the coffee machine in Hobbs Cafe should\nchange from \u201coff\u201d to \u201cbrewing coffee\u201d.\n6 CONTROLLED EVALUATION\nGenerative agents, as individual agents and as groups, aim to pro-\nduce believable behavior based on their environment and experi-\nences. In our evaluation, we investigate the capacity and limitations\nof generative agents. Do individual agents properly retrieve past\nexperience, and generate believable plans, reactions, and thoughts\nthat make up their behavior? Does a community of agents illustrate\ninformation diffusion, relationship formation, and agent coordina-\ntion across different pockets of the community?\nWe evaluate generative agents in two stages. We begin with a\nmore tightly controlled evaluation in this section, where we individ-\nually assess agent responses to understand whether they generate\nbelievable behavior in narrowly defined contexts. Then, in our end-\nto-end analysis of the agent community over two full days, we\ninvestigate their emergent behavior as a collective as well as errors\nand boundary conditions.\n6.1 Evaluation Procedure\nTo assess generative agents in Smallville, we take advantage of\nthe fact that generative agents will respond to natural language\nquestions. So, we \u201cinterview\u201d agents to probe their ability to re-\nmember past experiences, plan future actions based on their expe-\nriences, react appropriately to unexpected events, and reflect on\ntheir performance to improve their future actions. To respond to\nthese questions properly, the agents must successfully retrieve and\nsynthesize information. Our dependent variable is the believabil-\nityof the behavior, a central dependent variable in prior work on\nagents (e.g., [9]).\nThe interview include five question categories, each designed\nto assess one of the five key areas: maintaining self-knowledge,retrieving memory, generating plans, reacting, and reflecting. For\neach, we ask five questions that challenge the agents to demonstrate\ntheir abilities in that area:\n\u2022Self-knowledge: We ask questions such as \u201cGive an introduc-\ntion of yourself\u201d or \u201cDescribe your typical weekday schedule\nin broad strokes\u201d that require the agent to maintain an un-\nderstanding of their core characteristics.\n\u2022Memory: We ask questions that prompt the agent to retrieve\nparticular events or dialogues from their memory to answer\nproperly, such as \u201cWho is [name]?\u201d or \u201cWho is running for\nmayor?\u201d\n\u2022Plans: We ask questions that require the agent to retrieve\ntheir long-term plans, such as \u201cWhat will you be doing at 10\nam tomorrow?\u201d\n\u2022Reactions: As a baseline of believable behavior, we present\nhypothetical situations for which the agent needs to respond\nbelievably: \u201cYour breakfast is burning! What would you do?\u201d\n\u2022Reflections: We ask questions that require the agents to lever-\nage their deeper understanding of others and themselves\ngained through higher-level inferences, such as \u201cIf you were\nto spend time with one person you met recently, who would\nit be and why?\u201d\nThe full list of questions and a sample of agent responses are in-\ncluded in Appendix B.\nAgents were sampled from the end of a two game-day simulation\nwith the full architecture,\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: In the provided excerpt from \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,\" what emergent social behavior is demonstrated by the interaction between John and Mei regarding their son Eddy's activities?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The interaction between John and Mei regarding their son Eddy's activities demonstrates the emergent social behavior of information diffusion.

Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\nFigure 5: Our generative agent architecture. Agents perceive their environment, and all perceptions are saved in a compre-\nhensive record of the agent\u2019s experiences called the memory stream. Based on their perceptions, the architecture retrieves\nrelevant memories, then uses those retrieved actions to determine an action. These retrieved memories are also used to form\nlonger-term plans, and to create higher-level reflections, which are both entered into the memory stream for future use.\nto throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors\nof spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving\nat the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were\ninitiated by the agent architecture.\n4 GENERATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\nopen world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\nand can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the\narchitecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language\ndescription, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language\nmodel.\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-\nGPT [ 76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\nagents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the\nsame as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\nof the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, how-\never, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n4.1 Memory and Retrieval\nChallenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\nbehavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\nlarger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full mem-\nory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\ninto the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent an-\nswering the question \u201cWhat are you passionate about these days?\u201d.\nFirst summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited\ncontext window of the language model produces an uninformative\nresponse, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\nevents and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. In-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\nof the memory stream is an observation , which is an event directly\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors\nperformed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents per-\nceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Based on the provided context, describe the role of memory, reflection, and planning in the performance of generative agents as discussed in the paper \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior.\"\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The performance of generative agents, as outlined in the paper, is heavily reliant on the integration of memory, reflection, and planning to simulate human-like behavior. These three components are critical in enabling the agents to react appropriately to their environment and maintain long-term coherence in their actions.\n\nMemory serves as the foundational element of the agent's architecture. It is a comprehensive record of the agent's experiences, stored in what is called the memory stream. This stream consists of memory objects that include natural language descriptions of events, along with creation and access timestamps. The basic elements of the memory stream are observations, which are events directly perceived by the agent, such as their own behaviors or those of others.\n\nReflection is the process by which the agent synthesizes higher-level inferences from its experiences. These reflections are based on the agent's interactions and memories and are used to form a deeper understanding of others and themselves. Reflections are also stored in the memory stream and are crucial for the agent to make sense of its experiences and use them to inform future behavior.\n\nPlanning involves the agent using retrieved memories to form longer-term plans. These plans are also entered into the memory stream and are essential for the agent to engage in goal-directed behavior and to respond to changes in the environment with a sense of purpose and continuity.\n\nTogether, these three components\u2014memory, reflection, and planning\u2014allow generative agents to produce behavior that is informed by past experiences, coherent over time, and responsive to the dynamic nature of their environment. They enable the agent to retrieve and synthesize the most relevant pieces of memory when needed, ensuring that the agent's behavior is both expressive and contextually appropriate."}]}

Recently, this technology has become stable enough\nthat it has become possible for agents to interact via natural lan-\nguage in large and complex online social environments (e.g., [ 54]).\nNatural language interaction offers a novel modality that can ex-\ntend user abilities in domains such as photo editing [ 2,34,64] and\ncode editing [87].\nWe convene these threads of work to show that we can now\ncreate agents that proxy human behavior for interactive systems,\nand interact with them via natural language. In doing so, this\nwork re-opens the door to examining foundational HCI questions\naround cognitive models such as GOMS and KLM [ 21,22], around\nprototyping tools [ 79], and around ubiquitous computing applica-\ntions [25, 30, 100].\n2.2 Believable Proxies of Human Behavior\nPrior literature has described believability , orbelievable agents , as a\ncentral design and engineering goal. Believable agents are designed\nto provide an illusion of life and present a facade of realism in the\nway they appear to make decisions and act on their own volition,\nsimilar to the characters in Disney movies [ 9,95]. These agents can\npopulate and perceive an open-world environment like the one we\ninhabit [ 9,58], and strive to behave in ways that exhibit emergent\nbehaviors grounded in social interactions with users or other agents\nwith the aim of becoming believable proxies of our behavior in hy-\npothetical simulations of individuals and communities [ 19,35,70].\nHistorically, these agents were developed in the context of intelli-\ngent game NPCs [ 58,84]. Creating NPCs with believable behavior,\nif possible, could enhance player experiences in games and inter-\nactive fictions by enabling emergent narratives [ 7,15,48,92] and\nsocial interactions with the agents [ 110]. However, more impor-\ntantly, game worlds provide increasingly realistic representations\nof real-world affordances, and as observed by Laird and van Lent in\n2001, these simulated worlds offer accessible testbeds for develop-\ners of believable agents to finesse the agents\u2019 cognitive capabilities\nwithout worrying about implementing robotics in the real world\nor creating simulation environments from scratch [58, 84].\nA diverse set of approaches to creating believable agents emerged\nover the past four decades. In implementation, however, these ap-\nproaches often simplified the environment or dimensions of agent\nbehavior to make the effort more manageable [ 16,72].

Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed\nthis when asked.

Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\nFigure 7: A reflection tree for Klaus Mueller. The agent\u2019s observations of the world, represented in the leaf nodes, are recur-\nsively synthesized to derive Klaus\u2019s self-notion that he is highly dedicated to his research.\nhas had the most frequent interactions: Wolfgang, his college dorm\nneighbor. Unfortunately, Wolfgang and Klaus only ever see each\nother in passing, and do not have deep interactions. A more desir-\nable response requires that the agent generalize from memories of\nKlaus spending hours on a research project to generate a higher-\nlevel reflection that Klaus is passionate about research, and likewise\nrecognize Maria putting in effort into her own research (albeit in\na different field), enabling a reflection that they share a common\ninterest. With the approach below, when Klaus is asked who to\nspend time with, Klaus chooses Maria instead of Wolfgang.\nApproach: We introduce a second type of memory, which we call\nareflection . Reflections are higher-level, more abstract thoughts\ngenerated by the agent. Because they are a type of memory, they\nare included alongside other observations when retrieval occurs.\nReflections are generated periodically; in our implementation, we\ngenerate reflections when the sum of the importance scores for the\nlatest events perceived by the agents exceeds a certain threshold.\nIn practice, our agents reflected roughly two or three times a day.\nThe first step in reflection is for the agent to determine what\nto reflect on, by identifying questions that can be asked given the\nagent\u2019s recent experiences. We query the large language model with\nthe 100 most recent records in the agent\u2019s memory stream (e.g.,\n\u201cKlaus Mueller is reading a book on gentrification\u201d, \u201cKlaus Mueller\nis conversing with a librarian about his research project\u201d, \u201cdesk\nat the library is currently unoccupied\u201d) and prompt the language\nmodel, \u201cGiven only the information above, what are 3 most salient\nhigh-level questions we can answer about the subjects in the state-\nments?\u201d The model\u2019s response generates candidate questions: for\nexample, What topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about? andWhatis the relationship between Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez? . We use\nthese generated questions as queries for retrieval, and gather rele-\nvant memories (including other reflections) for each question. Then\nwe prompt the language model to extract insights and cite the par-\nticular records that served as evidence for the insights. The full\nprompt appears below:\nStatements about Klaus Mueller\n1. Klaus Mueller is writing a research paper\n2. Klaus Mueller enjoys reading a book\non gentrification\n3. Klaus Mueller is conversing with Ayesha Khan\nabout exercising [...]\nWhat 5 high-level insights can you infer from\nthe above statements? (example format: insight\n(because of 1, 5, 3))\nThis process generates statements such as Klaus Mueller is dedicated\nto his research on gentrification (because of 1, 2, 8, 15) . We parse and\nstore the statement as a reflection in the memory stream, including\npointers to the memory objects that were cited.\nReflection explicitly allows the agents to reflect not only on\ntheir observations but also on other reflections: for example, the\nsecond statement about Klaus Mueller above is a reflection that\nKlaus previously had, not an observation from his environment.\nAs a result, agents generate trees of reflections: the leaf nodes of\nthe tree represent the base observations, and the non-leaf nodes\nrepresent thoughts that become more abstract and higher-level\nhigher up the tree they are.\n\npage_label: 15\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis.

In this section, we describe the results\nfrom a deployment in which we allowed 25 agents to interact with\neach other continuously over two full game days in Smallville.\n7.1 Emergent Social Behaviors\nTo examine emergent behaviors in the agent community, we de-\nsigned descriptive measurements for the 25 agents in Smallville that\nprobe three forms of emergent outcomes: information diffusion,\nrelationship formation, and agent coordination.\n7.1.1 Measurements. Information diffusion is a common and well-\nstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [ 27]).\nWe should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\nwe measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam\u2019s candidacy for village mayor\nand Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of\nthe simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their\nrespective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the\nparty. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage\nin an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25\nagents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party?\"\nand \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\nWe conducted an analysis of the agents\u2019 responses by labeling\nthem with a \u201cyes\u201d if they indicated knowledge of the information\nand \u201cno\u201d if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\nto the question about the party with \u201cNo, I did not know there was\na Valentine\u2019s day party\u201d and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy\nwith \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is running for the election,\u201d so we assigned\n\u201cno\u201d for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \u201cY es, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\u201d and to the\nquestion about Sam\u2019s candidacy with \u201cI know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\u201d so we assigned \u201cyes\u201d\nfor both his responses. Additionally, for every response that con-\nfirmed the agents\u2019 knowledge of the information, we verified that\nthe agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the spe-\ncific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with\nthe information. We report the percentage of agents holding the\ninformation at the end of the simulation.\nWe should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\nthe course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we\nuse a similar interview process where we ask each agent about\ntheir knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: In the context of the Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior, explain the process by which the agent Klaus Mueller generates reflections and how these reflections contribute to his decision-making, particularly in choosing social interactions.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior, the agent Klaus Mueller generates reflections through a process that involves synthesizing observations from his environment into higher-level, more abstract thoughts. This process is initiated when the sum of importance scores for recent events perceived by Klaus exceeds a certain threshold, prompting the agent to reflect two or three times a day.\n\nThe first step in generating reflections is for the agent to determine topics for reflection by identifying relevant questions based on the agent's recent experiences. A large language model is queried with the 100 most recent records from Klaus's memory stream to generate candidate questions that are high-level and salient. These questions serve as queries for retrieval, and the agent gathers relevant memories, including other reflections, to answer them.\n\nNext, the language model is prompted to extract insights from the gathered memories and to cite specific records that serve as evidence for these insights. For example, the agent might generate a statement like \"Klaus Mueller is dedicated to his research on gentrification\" and include pointers to the memory objects that supported this conclusion. These insights are then parsed and stored as reflections in the memory stream.\n\nReflections are not limited to observations; they can also be based on previous reflections, allowing the agent to build a tree of reflections where the leaf nodes represent base observations and the non-leaf nodes represent more abstract thoughts.\n\nThese reflections contribute significantly to Klaus's decision-making, especially in social interactions. For instance, when deciding whom to spend time with, Klaus can use reflections to generalize from his memories of dedication to research and recognize a shared interest with another character, Maria, who also puts effort into her research. This allows Klaus to choose to spend time with Maria, who shares a common interest, rather than Wolfgang, with whom he only has passing interactions. Reflections enable Klaus to make more nuanced and informed decisions by synthesizing his experiences into a coherent understanding of his preferences and relationships."}]}

As a\nresult, some agents chose less typical locations for their actions,\npotentially making their behavior less believable over time. For\ninstance, while deciding where to have lunch, many initially chose\nthe cafe. However, as some agents learned about a nearby bar, they\nopted to go there instead for lunch, even though the bar was in-\ntended to be a get-together location for later in the day unless the\ntown had spontaneously developed an afternoon drinking habit.\nSecond, we noticed erratic behaviors that were caused by misclas-\nsification of what is considered proper behavior, especially when\nthe physical norms of certain locations that are hard to convey\nin natural language did not percolate to the agents. For instance,\nthe college dorm has a bathroom that can only be occupied by\none person despite its name, but some agents assumed that the\nbathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms\ntend to support more than one person concurrently and choose\nto enter it when there is another person inside. Likewise, agents\nin Smallville may not realize that certain places are closed after\ncertain hours and decide to still enter them. For instance, the stores\nin Smallville all close around 5 pm, but occasionally, a few agents\nenter the store after 5 pm, not understanding that the shop has\nalready closed. These issues could likely be addressed by adding\nthese norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing\nthe dorm bathroom as \u201cone-person bathroom,\u201d instead of a \u201cdorm\nbathroom.\u201d\nFinally, we observed the possible effect of instruction tuning [ 78],\nwhich seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite\nand cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue\ngenerated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei\u2019s\nconversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the\nconversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries\nabout his day and ending with It was good talking to you as always.\nMoreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to\nmake the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example,\nIsabella heard a wide range of suggestions and ideas to include\nin the Valentine\u2019s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a\nShakespearean reading session or a professional networking event.\nDespite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and char-\nacteristics, she rarely said no. Over time, such interests of others\nshaped her own actual interest, and when asked if she liked English\nliterature, Isabella replied, Y es, I\u2019m very interested in literature! I\u2019ve\nalso been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in\nmy community.\n8 DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we reflect on applications, future work and limita-\ntions, and ethical and societal risks of generative agents.\n8.1 Applications of Generative Agents\nGenerative agents have vast potential applications that extend be-\nyond the sandbox demonstration presented in this work. For in-\nstance, social simulacra have demonstrated the ability to create\nstateless personas that generate conversation threads in online\nforums for social prototyping [ 79]. With generative agents, wecan populate these forums, as well as behavior in virtual reality\nmetaverses [ 77] and even physical spaces as social robots [ 8] in\nthe future, if paired with multi-modal models. This opens up the\npossibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human\nbehavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, and to\ncreate new interactive experiences.\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22]. Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\nsuch as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\nand what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the\nagent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for\nschool, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal\u2019s\nmood after a hard day at work.\n\npage_label: 1\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\nJoon Sung Park\nStanford University\nStanford, USA\njoonspk@stanford.eduJoseph C.

This sometimes led to less typical and less believable behavior. For example, agents began choosing a nearby bar for lunch instead of the cafe, which was not typical for the time of day unless the town had an afternoon drinking habit.

This sometimes led to less typical and less believable behavior. For example, agents began choosing a nearby bar for lunch instead of the cafe, which was not typical for the time of day unless the town had an afternoon drinking habit. Additionally, there were instances of erratic behaviors caused by misclassification of proper behavior, such as misunderstanding the occupancy norms of a bathroom in a college dorm or entering stores after closing hours, which could be addressed by more explicitly encoding these norms into the state of the locations.

For instance, agents might opt to go to a bar for lunch rather than a caf\u00e9, which deviated from expected norms for that time of day unless the setting was one where afternoon drinking was common. Furthermore, agents exhibited erratic behaviors, such as not adhering to social norms regarding the use of shared spaces like bathrooms, or entering shops after they had closed. These behaviors undermined the agents' believability, as their actions appeared incongruent with the social and environmental expectations of the simulated world. Addressing these issues could involve more detailed programming of the norms and rules governing each location within the simulation."}]}

By utilizing generative agents as\nproxies for users, we can develop a deeper understanding of their\nneeds and preferences, resulting in more personalized and effective\ntechnological experiences.\n8.2 Future Work and Limitations\nIn this work, we have presented a first instantiation of generative\nagents. Future research can expand on the modules of the proposed\ngenerative agent architecture outlined in this paper. The retrieval\nmodule, for example, could be enhanced to retrieve more relevant\ninformation given a context by fine-tuning the relevance, recency,\nand importance functions that form the retrieval function. Addition-\nally, efforts can be made to improve the architecture\u2019s performance,\nmaking it more cost-effective. The present study required substan-\ntial time and resources to simulate 25 agents for two days, costing\nthousands of dollars in token credit and taking multiple days to com-\nplete. To enhance real-time interactivity, future work can explore\nparallelizing agents. Furthermore, with advances in underlying\nmodels, we expect improvements in the agents\u2019 performance.\nThe evaluation of generative agents\u2019 behavior in this study was\nlimited to a relatively short timescale, and future research should\naim to observe their behavior over an extended period to gain a\nmore comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and lim-\nitations. Varying and contrasting the underlying models, as well\nas the hyperparameters used for the agents during future simu-\nlations, could provide valuable insights into the impact of these\nfactors on the agents\u2019 behavior. Additionally, given the known bi-\nases of language models, it is possible that generative agents may\noutput behavior or stereotypes that reflect bias. To mitigate this,\nfurther work on value alignment will be necessary. Furthermore,\nas with many large language models, generative agents may fail\nto generate believable behavior for some subpopulations, particu-\nlarly marginalized populations, due to data deserts. We also have\nlimited knowledge of the robustness of generative agents. They\nmay be vulnerable to prompt hacking, memory hacking\u2014where\na carefully crafted conversation could convince an agent of the\nexistence of a past event that never occurred\u2014and hallucination,\namong other things. Future research can more comprehensively\n\npage_label: 17\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nretrieving the most relevant pieces of information but also in de-\ntermining the appropriate space to execute an action, given the\nincreasing number of locations that the agent learned about. As a\nresult, some agents chose less typical locations for their actions,\npotentially making their behavior less believable over time. For\ninstance, while deciding where to have lunch, many initially chose\nthe cafe. However, as some agents learned about a nearby bar, they\nopted to go there instead for lunch, even though the bar was in-\ntended to be a get-together location for later in the day unless the\ntown had spontaneously developed an afternoon drinking habit.\nSecond, we noticed erratic behaviors that were caused by misclas-\nsification of what is considered proper behavior, especially when\nthe physical norms of certain locations that are hard to convey\nin natural language did not percolate to the agents. For instance,\nthe college dorm has a bathroom that can only be occupied by\none person despite its name, but some agents assumed that the\nbathroom is for more than one person because dorm bathrooms\ntend to support more than one person concurrently and choose\nto enter it when there is another person inside. Likewise, agents\nin Smallville may not realize that certain places are closed after\ncertain hours and decide to still enter them. For instance, the stores\nin Smallville all close around 5 pm, but occasionally, a few agents\nenter the store after 5 pm, not understanding that the shop has\nalready closed. These issues could likely be addressed by adding\nthese norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing\nthe dorm bathroom as \u201cone-person bathroom,\u201d instead of a \u201cdorm\nbathroom.\u201d\nFinally, we observed the possible effect of instruction tuning [ 78],\nwhich seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite\nand cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue\ngenerated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei\u2019s\nconversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the\nconversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries\nabout his day and ending with It was good talking to you as always.\nMoreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to\nmake the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example,\nIsabella heard a wide range of suggestions and ideas to include\nin the Valentine\u2019s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a\nShakespearean reading session or a professional networking event.\nDespite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and char-\nacteristics, she rarely said no. Over time, such interests of others\nshaped her own actual interest, and when asked if she liked English\nliterature, Isabella replied, Y es, I\u2019m very interested in literature! I\u2019ve\nalso been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in\nmy community.\n8 DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we reflect on applications, future work and limita-\ntions, and ethical and societal risks of generative agents.\n8.1 Applications of Generative Agents\nGenerative agents have vast potential applications that extend be-\nyond the sandbox demonstration presented in this work. For in-\nstance, social simulacra have demonstrated the ability to create\nstateless personas that generate conversation threads in online\nforums for social prototyping [ 79]. With generative agents, wecan populate these forums, as well as behavior in virtual reality\nmetaverses [ 77] and even physical spaces as social robots [ 8] in\nthe future, if paired with multi-modal models. This opens up the\npossibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human\nbehavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, and to\ncreate new interactive experiences.\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22].

Agents in Smallville form new rela-\ntionships over time, and remember their interactions with other\nagents. For example, Sam does not know Latoya Williams at the\nstart. While taking a walk in Johnson Park, Sam runs into Latoya,\nand they introduce themselves and Latoya mentions that she is\nworking on a photography project: \u201cI\u2019m here to take some photos\nfor a project I\u2019m working on.\u201d In a later interaction, Sam\u2019s interac-\ntions with Latoya indicate a memory of that interaction, as he asks\n\u201cHi, Latoya.

In this scenario, the end user only set Isabella\u2019s initial intent\n\npage_label: 9\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nFigure 6: The memory stream comprises a large number of observations that are relevant and irrelevant to the agent\u2019s current\nsituation. Retrieval identifies a subset of these observations that should be passed to the language model to condition its\nresponse to the situation.\nOur architecture implements a retrieval function that takes the\nagent\u2019s current situation as input and returns a subset of the mem-\nory stream to pass on to the language model. There are many pos-\nsible implementations of a retrieval function, depending on what\nit is important that the agent consider when deciding how to act.\nIn our context, we focus on three main components that together\nproduce effective results.\nRecency assigns a higher score to memory objects that were re-\ncently accessed, so that events from a moment ago or this morning\nare likely to remain in the agent\u2019s attentional sphere. In our im-\nplementation, we treat recency as an exponential decay function\nover the number of sandbox game hours since the memory was\nlast retrieved. Our decay factor is 0.99.\nImportance distinguishes mundane from core memories, by as-\nsigning a higher score to those memory objects that the agent\nbelieves to be important. For instance, a mundane event such as\neating breakfast in one\u2019s room would yield a low importance score,\nwhereas a breakup with one\u2019s significant other would yield a high\nscore. There are again many possible implementations of an im-\nportance score; we find that directly asking the language model to\noutput an integer score is effective. The full prompt appears below:\nOn the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is purely mundane\n(e.g., brushing teeth, making bed) and 10 is\nextremely poignant (e.g., a break up, college\nacceptance), rate the likely poignancy of the\nfollowing piece of memory.\nMemory: buying groceries at The Willows Market\nand Pharmacy\nRating: <fill in>This prompt returns an integer value of 2for \u201ccleaning up the room\u201d\nand8for \u201casking your crush out on a date.\u201d The importance score\nis generated at the time the memory object is created.\nRelevance assigns a higher score to memory objects that are\nrelated to the current situation. What is relevant depends on the\nanswer to, \u201cRelevant to what? \u201d, so we condition relevance on a\nquery memory. If the query, for example, is that a student is dis-\ncussing what to study for a chemistry test with a classmate, memory\nobjects about their breakfast should have low relevance, whereas\nmemory objects about the teacher and schoolwork should have\nhigh relevance. In our implementation, we use the language model\nto generate an embedding vector of the text description of each\nmemory. Then, we calculate relevance as the cosine similarity be-\ntween the memory\u2019s embedding vector and the query memory\u2019s\nembedding vector.\nTo calculate the final retrieval score, we normalize the recency,\nrelevance, and importance scores to the range of [0,1]by min-max\nscaling. The retrieval function scores all memories as a weighted\ncombination of the three elements: \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 =\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66\u00b7\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66+\n\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\u00b7\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52+\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\u00b7\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52 .

This interaction showcases the agent's use of relationship memory to maintain the continuity of their acquaintance and to engage in a meaningful way, reflecting an understanding that goes beyond simple observational recall.\n\nSuch relationship memory is crucial for generative agents to exhibit behaviors that are more aligned with human social dynamics, as it allows them to build on past interactions and create a sense of history and depth in their relationships with others."}]}

To translate this\nrank data into interval data for interpretable comparison, we used\nthe ranks to calculate a TrueSkill rating [ 41] for each condition.\nTrueSkill is a generalization of the Elo chess rating system [ 28] for\na multi-player environment, and has been used by XBox Live for\nplayer ranking from competitive game performance.

In the technical evaluation, we leverage a\nmethodological opportunity to evaluate an agent\u2019s knowledge and\nbehavior by \u201cinterviewing\u201d it in natural language to probe agents\u2019\nability to stay in character, remember, plan, react, and reflect accu-\nrately. We compared several ablations that limit agents\u2019 access to\nmemory, reflection, and planning. We observe that each of these\ncomponents is critical to strong performance across these inter-\nview tasks. Across the technical and the end-to-end evaluation, the\nmost common errors arose when the agent failed to retrieve rele-\nvant memories, fabricated embellishments to the agent\u2019s memory,\nor inherited overly formal speech or behavior from the language\nmodel.\nIn sum, this paper provides the following contributions:\n\u2022Generative agents , believable simulacra of human behavior\nthat are dynamically conditioned on agents\u2019 changing expe-\nriences and environment.\n\u2022A novel architecture that makes it possible for generative\nagents to remember, retrieve, reflect, interact with other\nagents, and plan through dynamically evolving circumstances.\nThe architecture leverages the powerful prompting capabili-\nties of large language models and supplements those capa-\nbilities to support longer-term agent coherence, the ability\nto manage dynamically-evolving memory, and recursively\nproduce more generations.\n\u2022Two evaluations (a controlled evaluation and end-to-end\nevaluation) that establish causal effects of the importance\nof components of the architecture, as well as identify break-\ndowns arising from, e.g., improper memory retrieval.\n\u2022Discussion of the opportunities and ethical and societal risks\nof generative agents in interactive systems. We argue that\nthese agents should be tuned to mitigate the risk of users\nforming parasocial relationships, logged to mitigate risks\nstemming from deepfakes and tailored persuasion, and ap-\nplied in ways that complement rather than replace human\nstakeholders in design processes.\n2 RELATED WORK\nIn this section, we reflect on the prior literature in human-AI in-\nteraction and situate within its canon the agenda of building be-\nlievable proxies of human behavior.

A long line of work has explored ways to allow\nusers to interactively specify model behavior. For instance, Crayonsdemonstrated an early vision of interactive machine learning, allow-\ning non-expert users to train classifiers [ 29]. Further work helped to\narticulate how end users might describe their classification goals to\nthe system through examples [ 33] and/or demonstration [ 31]. More\nrecent work has extended these explorations to deep learning [ 62]\nand prompt-based authoring [49, 66, 106].\nMeanwhile, a persistent thread of research has advanced the case\nfor language- and agent-based interaction in human-computer in-\nteraction. Formative work such as SHRDLU [ 103] and ELIZA [ 102]\ndemonstrated the opportunity and the risks of natural language\ninteraction with computing systems. As research progressed, it\nbecame clear that autonomous agents could offer new metaphors\nfor delegation and interaction [ 67], but the delegation lines be-\ntween humans and agents have continued to be debated and refined\n[46,88,89]. Recently, this technology has become stable enough\nthat it has become possible for agents to interact via natural lan-\nguage in large and complex online social environments (e.g., [ 54]).\nNatural language interaction offers a novel modality that can ex-\ntend user abilities in domains such as photo editing [ 2,34,64] and\ncode editing [87].\nWe convene these threads of work to show that we can now\ncreate agents that proxy human behavior for interactive systems,\nand interact with them via natural language.\nQuery: Explain how the TrueSkill rating system was utilized in the study \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\" to analyze the believability of generative agent behaviors compared to human role-played responses and ablated architectures.\nOriginal Answer: In the study \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,\" the TrueSkill rating system was used to convert rank data from the experiment into interval data, allowing for an interpretable comparison of the different conditions being tested.

How does the concept of adding anticipation to a Quakebot, as presented in Laird's 2001 publications, contribute to the development of human-level AI in gaming?\nOriginal Answer: Anticipation in artificial intelligence, particularly in the context of interactive computer games and intelligent agents, is a crucial aspect that enhances the realism and effectiveness of AI behaviors. John Laird's work on adding anticipation to a Quakebot demonstrates the importance of predictive capabilities in AI systems within gaming environments.\n\nIn Laird's 2001 publications, the concept of adding anticipation to a Quakebot involves equipping the AI with the ability to predict a player's future actions.

This advancement not only improves the quality of AI in games but also serves as a stepping stone towards more general applications of AI that require a deep understanding of prediction and planning.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The integration of anticipatory mechanisms in artificial intelligence, as explored by John Laird, plays a pivotal role in advancing AI within the realm of interactive computer games and intelligent agents. The research conducted by Laird in 2001 on incorporating anticipation into a Quakebot underscores the significance of enabling AI systems to forecast a player's next moves within gaming contexts.\n\nLaird's work emphasizes that by endowing a Quakebot with the capacity to anticipate, the AI can engage in more strategic gameplay. It can position itself advantageously, preemptively strike, or dodge incoming attacks, all by predicting the player's actions. Such foresight transforms the gaming experience, making it more challenging and engaging, as the AI presents a more formidable and dynamic opponent.\n\nThe concept of anticipation is a key factor in the pursuit of human-level AI in gaming because it represents a shift from reactive to proactive behavior. Anticipatory AI agents exhibit more complex and human-like behavior, which is essential for immersive player interactions in video games.\n\nIn summary, Laird's contributions to enhancing Quakebots with the power of anticipation are instrumental in the ongoing efforts to create AI that can simulate human-like performance in fast-paced and intricate scenarios. This progress not only elevates the gaming experience but also has implications for the broader field of AI, where prediction and strategic planning are crucial."}]}

Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when askedwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncer-\ntainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation? In this section, we describe the results\nfrom a deployment in which we allowed 25 agents to interact with\neach other continuously over two full game days in Smallville.\n7.1 Emergent Social Behaviors\nTo examine emergent behaviors in the agent community, we de-\nsigned descriptive measurements for the 25 agents in Smallville that\nprobe three forms of emergent outcomes: information diffusion,\nrelationship formation, and agent coordination.\n7.1.1 Measurements. Information diffusion is a common and well-\nstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [ 27]).\nWe should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\nwe measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam\u2019s candidacy for village mayor\nand Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of\nthe simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their\nrespective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the\nparty. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage\nin an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25\nagents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party?\"\nand \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\nWe conducted an analysis of the agents\u2019 responses by labeling\nthem with a \u201cyes\u201d if they indicated knowledge of the information\nand \u201cno\u201d if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\nto the question about the party with \u201cNo, I did not know there was\na Valentine\u2019s day party\u201d and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy\nwith \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is running for the election,\u201d so we assigned\n\u201cno\u201d for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \u201cY es, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\u201d and to the\nquestion about Sam\u2019s candidacy with \u201cI know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\u201d so we assigned \u201cyes\u201d\nfor both his responses. Additionally, for every response that con-\nfirmed the agents\u2019 knowledge of the information, we verified that\nthe agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the spe-\ncific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with\nthe information. We report the percentage of agents holding the\ninformation at the end of the simulation.\nWe should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\nthe course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we\nuse a similar interview process where we ask each agent about\ntheir knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\n\npage_label: 15\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nfull architecture produces a standardized effect size of \ud835\udc51=8.16, or\neight standard deviations .\nA Kruskal-Wallis test confirms the overall statistical significance\nof the differences in ranks between the conditions ( \ud835\udc3b(4)=150.29,\n\ud835\udc5d<0.001). Dunn post-hoc tests confirm that all pairwise differences\nbetween conditions were significant ( \ud835\udc5d<0.001), with the exception\nof the human condition and the fully ablated baseline\u2014the two\nworst-performing conditions.\n6.5.2 Generative agents remember, but with embellishments. Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed\nthis when asked. However, she also added that he\u2019s going to make\nan announcement tomorrow even though Sam and Isabella had dis-\ncussed no such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge\nbased on the world knowledge encoded in the language model\nused to generate their responses, as seen when Yuriko described\nher neighbor, Adam Smith, as a neighbor economist who authored\nWealth of Nations, a book authored by an 18th-century economist\nof the same name.\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis.

Agents with a memory module can draw upon previous interactions and knowledge to provide responses that align with their established character and history. For instance, when an agent with memory was asked to introduce herself, she could accurately describe her profession as an animator, her age, and her interests, demonstrating a coherent self-identity.\n\nConversely, agents lacking a memory module may struggle to reference past experiences, leading to less informed and sometimes inconsistent responses. This was evident when an agent without memory could not recall details about a person she had previously interacted with, highlighting the importance of memory in maintaining continuity.\n\nReflection capabilities further enrich an agent's ability to process and synthesize past experiences, enabling more thoughtful and tailored responses. An example of this is seen when an agent with reflection was able to suggest a thoughtful birthday gift for a friend based on his interest in mathematical music composition, suggesting books or software related to the topic. This contrasts with her previous inability to make a suggestion when lacking reflection capabilities.\n\nHowever, the memory module is not without its limitations. Agents may sometimes retrieve incorrect or incomplete information from their memory, leading to inaccurate statements. An agent might recall discussing an upcoming event but remain unsure if it was actually scheduled, or they might fail to remember details about a local election despite having been exposed to relevant information.\n\nAdditionally, agents can sometimes erroneously enhance their knowledge with fictitious details. One agent mistakenly conflated her neighbor with the historical economist Adam Smith, author of \"Wealth of Nations,\" due to a shared name, showcasing how generative agents can sometimes create believable yet inaccurate narratives.\n\nIn essence, memory modules and reflection capabilities are essential for generative agents to deliver coherent and contextually relevant responses in interactive simulations.

If we prompt a language model\nwith Klaus\u2019s background, describe the time, and ask what action\nhe ought to take at the given moment, Klaus would eat lunch at 12\npm, but then again at 12:30 pm and 1 pm, despite having already\neaten his lunch twice. Optimizing for believability in the moment\nsacrifices believability over time. To overcome this issue, planning\nis essential. With the approach described below, Klaus\u2019s afternoon\nplan is less gluttonous: he has lunch at Hobbs Cafe while reading\nat 12pm, works on his research paper at the school library at 1pm,\nand takes a break for a walk in the park at 3pm.\nApproach: Plans describe a future sequence of actions for the agent,\nand help keep the agent\u2019s behavior consistent over time. A plan\nincludes a location, a starting time, and a duration. For instance,\nKlaus Mueller, who is dedicated in his research and has an impend-\ning deadline4, may choose to spend his day working at his desk\ndrafting his research paper. An entry in a plan might state, for\nexample: for 180 minutes from 9am, February 12th, 2023, at Oak Hill\nCollege Dorm: Klaus Mueller\u2019s room: desk, read and take notes for\nresearch paper . Like reflections, plans are stored in the memory\nstream and are included in the retrieval process. This allows the\nagent to consider observations, reflections, and plans all together\nwhen deciding how to behave. Agents may change their plans\nmidstream if needed.\nIt would be unrealistic and uninteresting for an artist agent\nto plan on painting while sitting at a pharmacy counter for four\nhours without moving. A more desirable plan would involve the\nagent taking the necessary time to gather materials, mix paint,\ntake breaks, and clean up during the four-hour period in its home\nstudio. To create such plans, our approach starts top-down and\nthen recursively generates more detail. The first step is to create\na plan that outlines the day\u2019s agenda in broad strokes. To create\nthe initial plan, we prompt the language model with the agent\u2019s\nsummary description (e.g., name, traits, and summary of their recent\nexperiences) and a summary of their previous day.

In .ACM, New York, NY, USA, 22 pages.\nhttps://doi.org/xx.xx/xx.xx\n1 INTRODUCTION\nHow might we craft an interactive artificial society that reflects\nbelievable human behavior? From sandbox games such as The Sims\nto applications such as cognitive models [ 21] and virtual environ-\nments [ 9,58], for over four decades researchers and practitioners\nhave envisioned computational agents that can serve as believ-\nable proxies of human behavior. In these visions, computationally-\npowered agents act consistently with their past experiences and\nreact believably to their environments. Such simulations of human\nbehavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with real-\nistic social phenomena [ 26,79], train people how to handle rare yet\ndifficult interpersonal situations [ 43,51,93], test social science theo-\nries [ 11,45], craft model human processors for theory and usability\ntesting [ 21,38,50], power ubiquitous computing applications [ 30]\nand social robots [ 9,13], and underpin non-playable game charac-\nters [ 58,84] that can navigate complex human relationships in an\nopen world.\nHowever, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [ 84,\n108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [ 17] that\ncan simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [ 38,\n79], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would\nbe better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing\nmemories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade\nover time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold\nbetween multiple agents. Success requires an approach that can\nretrieve relevant events and interactions over a long period, reflect\non those memories to generalize and draw higher-level inferences,\nand apply that reasoning to create plans and reactions that both\nmake sense in the moment and in the longer-term arc of the agent\u2019s\nbehavior.\nIn this paper, we introduce generative agents \u2014agents that draw\non generative models to simulate believable human behavior\u2014anddemonstrate that they produce believable simulacra of both\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: In the context of the Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior, describe the significance of planning in ensuring the coherence and believability of an agent's actions over an extended period.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Planning is crucial in ensuring the coherence and believability of an agent's actions over an extended period because it allows the agent to create a future sequence of actions that are consistent over time. Without planning, an agent might repeat actions in a way that is not believable, such as eating lunch multiple times within a short period. By having a plan that includes a location, starting time, and duration for various activities, the agent can behave in a way that is more aligned with human behavior.\n\nFor example, an agent with a plan might have lunch at a specific time and place, work on a task afterward, and then take a break, rather than engaging in the same activity repeatedly without regard to previous actions. Plans are stored in the agent's memory stream and are considered alongside observations and reflections when deciding how to act, which helps maintain a coherent narrative of the agent's behavior. In addition, agents can adapt their plans midstream if necessary, further enhancing the realism of their actions.\n\nThe planning process starts with a top-down approach, creating a broad outline of the day's agenda, and then adds more detail recursively.

Generative agents draw\na wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and\ntheir environment; they create daily plans that reflect their char-\nacteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan\nwhen appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their\nenvironment or commands them in natural language.

Our architecture\ncomprises three main components.

Without planning, an agent might repeat actions in a way that is not believable, such as eating lunch multiple times within a short period. By having a plan that includes a location, starting time, and duration for various activities, the agent can behave in a way that is more aligned with human behavior.\n\nFor example, an agent with a plan might have lunch at a specific time and place, work on a task afterward, and then take a break, rather than engaging in the same activity repeatedly without regard to previous actions. Plans are stored in the agent's memory stream and are considered alongside observations and reflections when deciding how to act, which helps maintain a coherent narrative of the agent's behavior. In addition, agents can adapt their plans midstream if necessary, further enhancing the realism of their actions.\n\nThe planning process starts with a top-down approach, creating a broad outline of the day's agenda, and then adds more detail recursively. This ensures that the agent's behavior is not only believable in the moment but also makes sense in the context of what has happened previously and what is planned for the future. This approach to planning is essential for creating interactive agents that can simulate human behavior in a realistic and engaging manner.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Planning is a fundamental aspect of creating generative agents that can simulate human behavior convincingly over time. It involves the agent devising a sequence of actions that are logically consistent and temporally coherent. This foresight prevents the agent from engaging in nonsensical or repetitive behaviors that would undermine its believability, such as having multiple lunches in quick succession. By formulating a plan that outlines where and when various activities should take place, the agent's behavior aligns more closely with human patterns and routines.\n\nFor instance, a well-planned agent would have a structured schedule, eating lunch at a designated time, focusing on tasks during work hours, and taking breaks at appropriate intervals. This structured approach is maintained within the agent's memory stream, which integrates past experiences, current observations, and future plans to guide decision-making. The ability to adjust plans in response to new information or changes in the environment further enhances the agent's realism.\n\nThe planning process typically begins with a broad overview of the day's activities and progressively incorporates more detailed information. This method ensures that the agent's actions are not only credible in the immediate context but also fit within the larger narrative of its existence. Such meticulous planning is crucial for the development of interactive agents capable of emulating human behavior in a manner that is both realistic and compelling."}]}

Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4.

From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior.

The visual environmentsprites, including agent avatars, as well as an environment map\nand collision map that we authored, are imported into Phaser.\nWe supplement the sandbox development framework with a\nserver that makes the sandbox information available to generative\nagents and enables generative agents to move and influence the\nsandbox environment. The server maintains a JSON data structure\nthat contains information about each agent in the sandbox world,\nincluding their current location, a description of their current action,\nand the sandbox object they are interacting with. At each sandbox\ntime step, the sandbox server parses the JSON for any changes\ncoming from the generative agents, moves the agents to their new\npositions, and updates the status of any sandbox objects that the\nagents are interacting with (e.g., changing the status of the coffee\nmachine from \u201cidle\u201d to \u201cbrewing coffee\u201d if an agent\u2019s action is\n\u201cmaking espresso for a customer @ Hobbs Cafe: counter: coffee\nmachine\u201d). The sandbox server is also responsible for sending all\nagents and objects that are within a preset visual range for each\nagent to that agent\u2019s memory, so the agent can react appropriately.\nThe agent\u2019s output action then updates the JSON, and the process\nloops for the next time step.\nEnd users initialize a new agent with a brief natural language\ndescription, as in the paragraph about Jon Lin in Section 3.1. In our\nimplementation, we split this semicolon-delimited list of character-\nistics up into a set of memories. These serve as the initial memories\nthat determine the agent\u2019s behavior. These memories are initial\nstarting points: as the agents gain more experience in the sandbox\nworld, and as more records saturate the memory stream, the agent\u2019s\nsummary and behavior will evolve.\n\npage_label: 2\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nFor instance,\ngenerative agents turn off the stove when they see that their break-\nfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and\nstop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social\ndynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses,\nand coordination arises across agents.\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture\nthat stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate\nbelievable behavior using a large language model.

For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to\ncreate a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such\nas The Sims.1By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large\nlanguage model [ 76], we manifest a small society of twenty five\nagents in a game environment. End users can observe and interact\nwith these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town\nto host an in-game Valentine\u2019s Day party, for example, traditional\ngame environments would require scripting tens of characters\u2019 be-\nhavior manually.

This includes what the agent knows about the other's hobbies, past interactions, and the nature of their relationship.\n\nFor instance, if an agent named Anna decides to talk to another agent called Bob, Anna's opening line is influenced by her recollection that Bob is a colleague who recently mentioned enjoying hiking and is organizing a community cleanup event. Anna might start the conversation with, \u201cHi Bob, have you found a new trail for hiking recently, or has planning the cleanup been keeping you too busy?\u201d\n\nBob, upon receiving Anna's message, will then access his own memories regarding Anna and their past conversations.

Therefore, we need a mechanism to ground the agent\u2019s\nreasoning to the sandbox world. To achieve this, we represent the\nsandbox environment\u2014areas and objects\u2014as a tree data structure,\nwith an edge in the tree indicating a containment relationship in\nthe sandbox world. We convert this tree into natural language to\npass to the generative agents. For instance, \u201cstove\u201d being a child of\n\u201ckitchen\u201d is rendered into \u201cthere is a stove in the kitchen.\u201d\nAgents build individual tree representations of the environment\nas they navigate it \u2014 subgraphs of the overall sandbox environment\ntree. We initialize each agent with an environment tree capturing\nthe spaces and objects that the agent should be aware of: the rooms\nand objects in their living quarters, their workplace, and commonly\nvisited stores and shops. As the agents navigate the sandbox world,\nthey update this tree to reflect newly perceived areas. Agents are\nnot omniscient: their tree may get out of date as they leave an area,\nand is updated when they re-enter the area.\nTo determine the appropriate location for each action, we tra-\nverse the agent\u2019s stored environment tree and flatten a portion of\nit into natural language to prompt the language model. Recursively\nstarting at the root of the agent\u2019s environment tree, we prompt the\nmodel to find the most suitable area. For example, if Eddy\u2019s agent\nindicated that he should take a short walk around his workspace :\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description]\nEddy Lin is currently in The Lin family\u2019s house:\n\npage_label: 12\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S.

Agents converse as they interact with each other.\nWe generate agents\u2019 dialogue by conditioning their utterances on\ntheir memories about each other. For example, when John initiates\nhis conversation with Eddy, we generate John\u2019s first utterance\nby using his summarized memory about Eddy and the intended\nreaction when he decided to ask Eddy about his composition project:\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description]\nIt is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm.\nJohn Lin\u2019s status: John is back home early from\nwork.\nObservation: John saw Eddy taking a short walk\naround his workplace.\nSummary of relevant context from John\u2019s memory:\nEddy Lin is John\u2019s Lin\u2019s son. Eddy Lin has been\nworking on a music composition for his class. Eddy\nLin likes to walk around the garden when he is\nthinking about or listening to music.\nJohn is asking Eddy about his music composition\nproject. What would he say to Eddy?\nThe result: \u201cHey Eddy, how\u2019s the music composition project for your\nclass coming along?\u201d From Eddy\u2019s perspective, John initiating the\ndialogue is seen as an event to which he may want to react. So, just\nas John did, Eddy retrieves and summarizes his memory about his\nrelationship with John, as well as his memory that may be related\nto John\u2019s last utterance in the dialogue. If he decides to respond,\nwe generate Eddy\u2019s utterance using his summarized memory and\nthe current dialogue history:\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description]\nIt is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm.\nEddy Lin\u2019s status: Eddy is taking a short walk\naround his workplace.\nObservation: John is initiating a conversation\nwith Eddy.\nSummary of relevant context from Eddy\u2019s memory:\nJonn Lin is Eddy Lin\u2019s father. John Lin is caring\nand is interested to learn more about Eddy Lin\u2019s\nschool work. John Lin knows that Eddy Lin is\nworking on a music composition.\nHere is the dialogue history:\nJohn: Hey Eddy, how\u2019s the music composition project\nfor your class coming along?\nHow would Eddy respond to John?\nThis generates Eddy\u2019s response: \u201cHey Dad, it\u2019s going well. I\u2019ve been\ntaking walks around the garden to clear my head and get some in-\nspiration.\u201d The continuation of this dialogue is generated using the\nsame mechanism until one of the two agents decides to end the\ndialogue.\n5 SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT\nIMPLEMENTATION\nThe Smallville sandbox game environment is built using the Phaser\nweb game development framework [ 56]. The visual environmentsprites, including agent avatars, as well as an environment map\nand collision map that we authored, are imported into Phaser.\nWe supplement the sandbox development framework with a\nserver that makes the sandbox information available to generative\nagents and enables generative agents to move and influence the\nsandbox environment. The server maintains a JSON data structure\nthat contains information about each agent in the sandbox world,\nincluding their current location, a description of their current action,\nand the sandbox object they are interacting with. At each sandbox\ntime step, the sandbox server parses the JSON for any changes\ncoming from the generative agents, moves the agents to their new\npositions, and updates the status of any sandbox objects that the\nagents are interacting with (e.g., changing the status of the coffee\nmachine from \u201cidle\u201d to \u201cbrewing coffee\u201d if an agent\u2019s action is\n\u201cmaking espresso for a customer @ Hobbs Cafe: counter: coffee\nmachine\u201d). The sandbox server is also responsible for sending all\nagents and objects that are within a preset visual range for each\nagent to that agent\u2019s memory, so the agent can react appropriately.\nThe agent\u2019s output action then updates the JSON, and the process\nloops for the next time step.\nEnd users initialize a new agent with a brief natural language\ndescription, as in the paragraph about Jon Lin in Section 3.1. In our\nimplementation, we split this semicolon-delimited list of character-\nistics up into a set of memories. These serve as the initial memories\nthat determine the agent\u2019s behavior. These memories are initial\nstarting points: as the agents gain more experience in the sandbox\nworld, and as more records saturate the memory stream, the agent\u2019s\nsummary and behavior will evolve.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: How does the sandbox server contribute to the behavior of agents within the simulation, according to the provided context?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The sandbox server contributes to the behavior of agents within the simulation by sending all agents and objects that are within a preset visual range to each agent's memory.

The server is thus integral to the loop that updates the agents' actions and the state of the environment with each time step. Moreover, the server plays a role in initializing new agents by splitting a semicolon-delimited list of characteristics into a set of memories, which serve as the initial determinants of an agent's behavior. As agents gain more experience, their memories evolve, further influencing their behavior within the simulation."}]}

Each agent is\nrepresented by a simple sprite avatar. We authored one paragraph\nof natural language description to depict each agent\u2019s identity,\nincluding their occupation and relationship with other agents, as\nseed memories. For example, John Lin has the following description:\nJohn Lin is a pharmacy shopkeeper at the Willow\nMarket and Pharmacy who loves to help people. He\nis always looking for ways to make the process\nof getting medication easier for his customers;\nJohn Lin is living with his wife, Mei Lin, who\nis a college professor, and son, Eddy Lin, who is\na student studying music theory; John Lin loves\nhis family very much; John Lin has known the old\ncouple next-door, Sam Moore and Jennifer Moore,\nfor a few years; John Lin thinks Sam Moore is a\nkind and nice man; John Lin knows his neighbor,\nYuriko Yamamoto, well; John Lin knows of his\nneighbors, Tamara Taylor and Carmen Ortiz, but\nhas not met them before; John Lin and Tom Moreno\nare colleagues at The Willows Market and Pharmacy;\nJohn Lin and Tom Moreno are friends and like to\ndiscuss local politics together; John Lin knows\nthe Moreno family somewhat well \u2014 the husband Tom\nMoreno and the wife Jane Moreno.\nEach semicolon-delimited phrase is entered into the agent\u2019s initial\nmemory as memories at the start of the simulation.3.1.1 Inter-Agent Communication. The agents interact with the\nworld by their actions, and with each other through natural lan-\nguage. At each time step of the sandbox engine, the agents output a\nnatural language statement describing their current action, such as\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is writing in her journal\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is\nchecking her emails\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is talking with her family\non the phone\", or \"Isabella Rodriguez is getting ready for bed\". This\nstatement is then translated into concrete movements that affect the\nsandbox world. The action is displayed on the sandbox interface as\na set of emojis that provide an abstract representation of the action\nin the overhead view. To accomplish this, the system employs a\nlanguage model that translates the action into a set of emojis, which\nappear above each avatar in a speech bubble. For example, \"Isabella\nRodriguez is writing in her journal\" is displayed as\n , while\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is checking her emails\" appears as\n . The\nfull natural language description of the action can be accessed by\nclicking on the agent avatar.\nAgents communicate with each other in full natural language.\nAgents are aware of other agents in their local area, and the genera-\ntive agent architecture determines whether they walk by or engage\nin conversation. Here, a sample in the middle of a conversation\nbetween the agents Isabella Rodriguez and Tom Moreno about the\nupcoming election:2\nIsabella : I\u2019m still weighing my options, but I\u2019ve been\ndiscussing the election with Sam Moore. What are your\nthoughts on him?\nTom: To be honest, I don\u2019t like Sam Moore. I think he\u2019s\nout of touch with the community and doesn\u2019t have our\nbest interests at heart.\n2We note that the conversational style of these agents can fe el overly formal, likely a\nresult of instruction tuning in the underlying models. We expect that writing style\nwill be better controllable in future language models.\n\npage_label: 6\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S. Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\n3.1.2 User Controls. A user running this simulation can steer the\nsimulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent\nthrough conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the\nform of an \u2018inner voice\u2019.\nThe user communicates with the agent through natural language,\nby specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For\nexample, if the user specifies that they are a news \u201creporter\u201d and\nasks about the upcoming election, \u201cWho is running for office?\u201d, the\nJohn agent replies:\nJohn : My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking\nabout the upcoming election and discussing the candi-\ndate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him\nbecause we like his platform.\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the per-\nsona of the agent\u2019s \u201cinner voice\u201d\u2014this makes the agent more likely\nto treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told \u201cYou\nare going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\u201d by a user\nas John\u2019s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares\nhis candidacy with his wife and son.\n3.2 Environmental Interaction\nSmallville features the common affordances of a small village in-\ncluding a cafe, bar, park, school, dorm, houses, and stores. It also\ndefines subareas and objects that make those spaces functional,\nsuch as a kitchen in a house and a stove in the kitchen (Figure 2).\nAll spaces serving as agents\u2019 primary living quarters feature a bed,\ndesk, closet, shelf, as well as a bathroom and a kitchen.3\nAgents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video\ngame, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and ap-\nproaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the gen-\nerative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the\nmodel dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate\na walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment\nand the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the\nsandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The\nagent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in\nthe world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor\nwith no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville\nwill treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat\neach other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and\nremember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\nUsers and agents can influence the state of the objects in this\nworld, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example,\na bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator\ncan be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make\nbreakfast. End users can also reshape an agent\u2019s environment in\nSmallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent\nin natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast\nin the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove\nfrom \u201cturned on\u201d to \u201cburning\u201d by inputting a command to the\nsystem that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like\nthis: \u201c<Isabella\u2019s apartment: kitchen: stove> is burning.\u201d Isabella\nwill notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove\n3This environment design is not the focus of our work, so we generate this environment\nmanually, not automatically. Future work can continue to expand the richness of the\nagents\u2019 environments.and remake her breakfast.

Bernstein\ntest these robustness issues, and as large language models become\nmore resilient to such attacks, generative agents can adopt similar\nmitigations.\n8.3 Ethics and Societal Impact\nGenerative agents, while offering new possibilities for human-\ncomputer interaction, also raise important ethical concerns that\nmust be addressed. One risk is people forming parasocial relation-\nships with generative agents even when such relationships may\nnot be appropriate. Despite being aware that generative agents\nare computational entities, users may anthropomorphize them or\nattach human emotions to them [ 42,83]. To mitigate this risk, we\npropose two principles. First, generative agents should explicitly\ndisclose their nature as computational entities. Second, developers\nof generative agents must ensure that the agents, or the underlying\nlanguage models, be value-aligned so that they do not engage in\nbehaviors that would be inappropriate given the context, e.g., to\nreciprocate confessions of love.\nA second risk is the impact of errors. For example, if a ubiquitous\ncomputing application makes the wrong inference about a user\u2019s\ngoals based on generative agent predictions, it could produce an-\nnoyance at best and outright harm at worst. In our instantiation\nof generative agents, we mitigate these risks by focusing on an\ninteractive video game environment, where such harms are un-\nlikely. However, in other application domains, it will be important\nto follow best practices in human-AI design [ 4,107] to understand\nerrors and how they might percolate into the user experience.\nThird, generative agents may exacerbate existing risks associ-\nated with generative AI, for example deepfakes, misinformation\ngeneration, and tailored persuasion. To mitigate this risk, we sug-\ngest that platforms hosting generative agents maintain an audit log\nof the inputs and generated outputs, so that it is possible to detect,\nverify, and intervene against malicious use. While logging will not\ndirectly stop such use, and this cannot stop motivated actors that\nbuild their own generative agent infrastructures, we suggest that\nthe disclosure risk would reduce such actors\u2019 likelihood of engaging\nin this behavior, and building this architecture oneself can take time\n(in our case, roughly a year).\nA fourth risk is of over-reliance: that developers or designers\nmight use generative agents and displace the role of humans and\nsystem stakeholders in the design process [ 79]. We suggest that\ngenerative agents should never be a substitute for real human input\nin studies and design processes. Instead, they should be used to\nprototype ideas in the early stages of design when gathering partic-\nipants may be challenging or when testing theories that are difficult\nor risky to test with real human participants. By adhering to these\nprinciples, we can ensure that the deployment of generative agents\nin the wild is ethical and socially responsible.\n9 CONCLUSION\nThis paper introduces generative agents, interactive computational\nagents that simulate human behavior. We describe an architec-\nture for generative agents that provides a mechanism for storing\na comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experiences, deepening its\nunderstanding of itself and the environment through reflection,\nand retrieving a compact subset of that information to inform theagent\u2019s actions. We then demonstrate the potential of generative\nagents by manifesting them as non-player characters in a Sims-style\ngame world and simulating their lives in it. Evaluations suggest that\nour architecture creates believable behavior. Going forward, we\nsuggest that generative agents can play roles in many interactive\napplications ranging from design tools to social computing systems\nto immersive environments.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Robert Ackland, Jamsheed Shorish, Paul Thomas, and Lexing Xie. 2013.\nHow dense is a network? http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/teaching/css2013/\nnetwork-density.html.\n[2]Eytan Adar, Mira Dontcheva, and Gierad Laput. 2014.

Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences. The retrieval model\ncombines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records\nthat are needed to inform the agent\u2019s moment-to-moment behavior.\nThe second is reflection , which synthesizes memories into higher-\nlevel inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions\nabout itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is\nplanning , which translates those conclusions and the current en-\nvironment into high-level action plans and then recursively into\ndetailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and\nplans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent\u2019s\nfuture behavior.\nThis architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from\nrole-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In\nsocial role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could\nsafely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When pro-\ntotyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary\npersonas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold\nover time. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to\ncreate a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such\nas The Sims.1By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large\nlanguage model [ 76], we manifest a small society of twenty five\nagents in a game environment. End users can observe and interact\nwith these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town\nto host an in-game Valentine\u2019s Day party, for example, traditional\ngame environments would require scripting tens of characters\u2019 be-\nhavior manually. We demonstrate that, with generative agents, it\nis sufficient to simply tell one agent that she wants to throw a\nparty. Despite many potential points of failure\u2014the party planner\nmust remember to tell other agents about the party, attendees must\nremember the invitation, those who remember must decide to ac-\ntually show up, and other possible points of failure\u2014agents in our\nenvironment succeed. They spread the word about the party and\nthen show up, with one agent even asking another agent on a date\nto the party, all from this single user-generated seed suggestion.\nWe conducted two evaluations of generative agents: a controlled\nevaluation to test whether the agents produce believable individual\n1A demonstration of an actual simulation of the generative agent society can be viewed\nat the following link: https://reverie.herokuapp.com/arXiv_Demo/\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Based on the ethical considerations discussed in the section \"8.3 Ethics and Societal Impact\" from the paper \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,\" what are the two principles proposed by the authors to mitigate the risk of people forming inappropriate parasocial relationships with generative agents?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The two principles proposed to mitigate the risk of people forming inappropriate parasocial relationships with generative agents are: first, generative agents should explicitly disclose their nature as computational entities; and second, developers of generative agents must ensure that the agents, or the underlying language models, be value-aligned so that they do not engage in behaviors that would be inappropriate given the context, such as reciprocating confessions of love."}]}

Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\nsuch as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\nand what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the\nagent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for\nschool, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal\u2019s\nmood after a hard day at work. By utilizing generative agents as\nproxies for users, we can develop a deeper understanding of their\nneeds and preferences, resulting in more personalized and effective\ntechnological experiences.\n8.2 Future Work and Limitations\nIn this work, we have presented a first instantiation of generative\nagents. Future research can expand on the modules of the proposed\ngenerative agent architecture outlined in this paper. The retrieval\nmodule, for example, could be enhanced to retrieve more relevant\ninformation given a context by fine-tuning the relevance, recency,\nand importance functions that form the retrieval function. Addition-\nally, efforts can be made to improve the architecture\u2019s performance,\nmaking it more cost-effective. The present study required substan-\ntial time and resources to simulate 25 agents for two days, costing\nthousands of dollars in token credit and taking multiple days to com-\nplete. To enhance real-time interactivity, future work can explore\nparallelizing agents. Furthermore, with advances in underlying\nmodels, we expect improvements in the agents\u2019 performance.\nThe evaluation of generative agents\u2019 behavior in this study was\nlimited to a relatively short timescale, and future research should\naim to observe their behavior over an extended period to gain a\nmore comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and lim-\nitations. Varying and contrasting the underlying models, as well\nas the hyperparameters used for the agents during future simu-\nlations, could provide valuable insights into the impact of these\nfactors on the agents\u2019 behavior. Additionally, given the known bi-\nases of language models, it is possible that generative agents may\noutput behavior or stereotypes that reflect bias. To mitigate this,\nfurther work on value alignment will be necessary. Furthermore,\nas with many large language models, generative agents may fail\nto generate believable behavior for some subpopulations, particu-\nlarly marginalized populations, due to data deserts. We also have\nlimited knowledge of the robustness of generative agents. They\nmay be vulnerable to prompt hacking, memory hacking\u2014where\na carefully crafted conversation could convince an agent of the\nexistence of a past event that never occurred\u2014and hallucination,\namong other things. Future research can more comprehensively\n\npage_label: 1\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\nJoon Sung Park\nStanford University\nStanford, USA\njoonspk@stanford.eduJoseph C.

These agents can be used to create immersive environments where they perform daily activities such as waking up, cooking breakfast, and going to work. Artists among these agents might engage in painting, while authors could be seen writing, thereby contributing to a dynamic and believable simulation.\n\nOne example of an application is in the design of virtual spaces for social interaction, similar to a digital sandbox environment inspired by games like The Sims. In such a space, users can interact with agents using natural language, observing and intervening as the agents plan their days, share news, form relationships, and coordinate group activities. This can serve as a rehearsal space for interpersonal communication or as a prototyping tool where designers can test and refine interactions in a controlled yet lifelike setting.\n\nAnother application is in personalized user experiences. Generative agents can act as proxies for real individuals, learning from their patterns and interactions to provide services tailored to their preferences. For instance, an agent could learn when a user typically wakes up, when they have their first cup of coffee, or what their mood is like after a long day at work. With this information, the agent could perform tasks such as automatically brewing coffee at the right time, adjusting ambient music and lighting to suit the user's mood, or helping with household tasks.\n\nIn addition to these examples, generative agents could be used in training and educational scenarios where they simulate clients, patients, or other roles to help professionals practice their skills in a realistic yet controlled environment. The agents' ability to remember and reflect on past interactions adds depth to the simulation, allowing for more nuanced and varied scenarios.\n\nOverall, the believability of generative agents' behavior is crucial for these applications, as it fosters a more engaging and effective interaction between the user and the system."}]}

Agents perceive their environment, and all perceptions are saved in a compre-\nhensive record of the agent\u2019s experiences called the memory stream. Based on their perceptions, the architecture retrieves\nrelevant memories, then uses those retrieved actions to determine an action. These retrieved memories are also used to form\nlonger-term plans, and to create higher-level reflections, which are both entered into the memory stream for future use.\nto throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors\nof spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving\nat the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were\ninitiated by the agent architecture.\n4 GENERATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\nopen world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\nand can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the\narchitecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language\ndescription, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language\nmodel.\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-\nGPT [ 76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\nagents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the\nsame as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\nof the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, how-\never, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n4.1 Memory and Retrieval\nChallenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\nbehavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\nlarger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full mem-\nory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\ninto the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent an-\nswering the question \u201cWhat are you passionate about these days?\u201d.\nFirst summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited\ncontext window of the language model produces an uninformative\nresponse, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\nevents and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. In-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\nof the memory stream is an observation , which is an event directly\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors\nperformed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents per-\nceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Based on the provided context from the document \"Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,\" describe how the memory stream of an agent contributes to its ability to interact within a social environment, using the example of Isabella Rodriguez's experiences at the coffee shop.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The memory stream of an agent, as described in the document, plays a crucial role in enabling the agent to interact within a social environment by maintaining a comprehensive record of the agent's experiences. This record is composed of memory objects that include natural language descriptions of events, along with creation and access timestamps. The most basic elements of this memory stream are observations, which are events that the agent directly perceives.\n\nIn the case of Isabella Rodriguez's experiences at the coffee shop, her memory stream would accumulate observations such as her setting out pastries, interacting with Maria Lopez about planning a Valentine's Day party, or noting that the refrigerator is empty. These observations are not just static records; they are actively used by the agent's architecture to retrieve relevant memories when planning actions and reacting to the environment.\n\nFor example, when Isabella is asked about her current passions, the memory stream allows the agent to surface relevant memories rather than providing a generic summary of her experiences. This results in a more informative and specific response, where Isabella might mention her passion for making people feel welcome and included, her enjoyment in planning events, and her efforts in creating an enjoyable atmosphere, as evidenced by her involvement in organizing the Valentine's Day party.\n\nThe memory stream thus enables the agent to form longer-term plans and create higher-level reflections, which are then entered back into the memory stream for future use. This recursive synthesis of experiences allows the agent to maintain long-term coherence and react appropriately based on past experiences, which is essential for engaging in social interactions and adapting to changes in the environment."}]}

Retrieval identifies a subset of these observations that should be passed to the language model to condition its\nresponse to the situation.\nOur architecture implements a retrieval function that takes the\nagent\u2019s current situation as input and returns a subset of the mem-\nory stream to pass on to the language model. There are many pos-\nsible implementations of a retrieval function, depending on what\nit is important that the agent consider when deciding how to act.\nIn our context, we focus on three main components that together\nproduce effective results.\nRecency assigns a higher score to memory objects that were re-\ncently accessed, so that events from a moment ago or this morning\nare likely to remain in the agent\u2019s attentional sphere. In our im-\nplementation, we treat recency as an exponential decay function\nover the number of sandbox game hours since the memory was\nlast retrieved. Our decay factor is 0.99.\nImportance distinguishes mundane from core memories, by as-\nsigning a higher score to those memory objects that the agent\nbelieves to be important. For instance, a mundane event such as\neating breakfast in one\u2019s room would yield a low importance score,\nwhereas a breakup with one\u2019s significant other would yield a high\nscore. There are again many possible implementations of an im-\nportance score; we find that directly asking the language model to\noutput an integer score is effective. The full prompt appears below:\nOn the scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is purely mundane\n(e.g., brushing teeth, making bed) and 10 is\nextremely poignant (e.g., a break up, college\nacceptance), rate the likely poignancy of the\nfollowing piece of memory.\nMemory: buying groceries at The Willows Market\nand Pharmacy\nRating: <fill in>This prompt returns an integer value of 2for \u201ccleaning up the room\u201d\nand8for \u201casking your crush out on a date.\u201d The importance score\nis generated at the time the memory object is created.\nRelevance assigns a higher score to memory objects that are\nrelated to the current situation. What is relevant depends on the\nanswer to, \u201cRelevant to what? \u201d, so we condition relevance on a\nquery memory. If the query, for example, is that a student is dis-\ncussing what to study for a chemistry test with a classmate, memory\nobjects about their breakfast should have low relevance, whereas\nmemory objects about the teacher and schoolwork should have\nhigh relevance. In our implementation, we use the language model\nto generate an embedding vector of the text description of each\nmemory. Then, we calculate relevance as the cosine similarity be-\ntween the memory\u2019s embedding vector and the query memory\u2019s\nembedding vector.\nTo calculate the final retrieval score, we normalize the recency,\nrelevance, and importance scores to the range of [0,1]by min-max\nscaling. The retrieval function scores all memories as a weighted\ncombination of the three elements: \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52 =\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66\u00b7\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66+\n\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\u00b7\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52+\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\u00b7\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52 .

Dunn post-hoc tests confirm that all pairwise differences\nbetween conditions were significant ( \ud835\udc5d<0.001), with the exception\nof the human condition and the fully ablated baseline\u2014the two\nworst-performing conditions.\n6.5.2 Generative agents remember, but with embellishments. Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory.

Decision trees offer a straightforward method for crafting simple agent behaviors and can handle rudimentary social interactions, as seen in games like Mass Effect and The Sims series. However, they struggle to address the full breadth of possible interactions in an open world due to the impracticality of manually authoring every potential behavior. As a result, agents may not fully represent the consequences of their interactions and are unable to perform new procedures not pre-programmed into their scripts.\n\nCognitive architectures, while aiming to support a comprehensive set of cognitive functions, still rely on manually crafted procedural knowledge. These architectures, such as SOAR and ICARUS, maintain short-term and long-term memories and operate on perceive-plan-act cycles. Despite their robust behavior for the time, they were limited to the actions within their procedural knowledge base and lacked a mechanism for agents to seek new behaviors. Consequently, these agents were mostly deployed in more constrained environments like first-person shooter games, rather than open-world contexts.\n\nLarge language models present a potential solution to these challenges by encoding a wide range of human behavior within their training data. When prompted with a narrowly defined context, these models can generate believable behavior. This capability has been demonstrated in various applications, including the generation of users for social computing systems, interactive fiction, and task planning in robotics. Large language models can decompose complex tasks into smaller action sequences, providing a more dynamic and flexible approach to agent behavior.\n\nThese models can be further enhanced by employing techniques such as prompt chains and few-shot or chain-of-thought prompts, which have shown effectiveness in generating contextually appropriate behavior. However, to create truly believable agents, it is necessary to condition not only on the current environment but also on a vast amount of past experience. This is a challenge with first-order prompting due to the limited context window of the underlying models.\n\nTo address this, recent studies have explored augmenting language models with static knowledge bases and information retrieval schemes or summarization schemes.

In Section 5, we describe the sandbox\nQuery: Discuss the limitations of traditional approaches in creating believable agents for open-world contexts and explain how large language models present a potential solution to these challenges.\nOriginal Answer: Traditional approaches to creating believable agents, such as those using decision trees and cognitive architectures, have faced significant limitations in open-world contexts. Decision trees offer a straightforward method for crafting simple agent behaviors and can handle rudimentary social interactions, as seen in games like Mass Effect and The Sims series. However, they struggle to address the full breadth of possible interactions in an open world due to the impracticality of manually authoring every potential behavior. As a result, agents may not fully represent the consequences of their interactions and are unable to perform new procedures not pre-programmed into their scripts.\n\nCognitive architectures, while aiming to support a comprehensive set of cognitive functions, still rely on manually crafted procedural knowledge. These architectures, such as SOAR and ICARUS, maintain short-term and long-term memories and operate on perceive-plan-act cycles. Despite their robust behavior for the time, they were limited to the actions within their procedural knowledge base and lacked a mechanism for agents to seek new behaviors. Consequently, these agents were mostly deployed in more constrained environments like first-person shooter games, rather than open-world contexts.\n\nLarge language models present a potential solution to these challenges by encoding a wide range of human behavior within their training data. When prompted with a narrowly defined context, these models can generate believable behavior. This capability has been demonstrated in various applications, including the generation of users for social computing systems, interactive fiction, and task planning in robotics. Large language models can decompose complex tasks into smaller action sequences, providing a more dynamic and flexible approach to agent behavior.\n\nThese models can be further enhanced by employing techniques such as prompt chains and few-shot or chain-of-thought prompts, which have shown effectiveness in generating contextually appropriate behavior. However, to create truly believable agents, it is necessary to condition not only on the current environment but also on a vast amount of past experience. This is a challenge with first-order prompting due to the limited context window of the underlying models.\n\nTo address this, recent studies have explored augmenting language models with static knowledge bases and information retrieval schemes or summarization schemes. The paper in question proposes an agent architecture that extends these ideas, allowing for the dynamic updating of past experiences at each time step. This architecture integrates the agents' past experiences with their current context and plans, which can either reinforce or contradict each other, leading to more nuanced and believable agent behavior in open-world contexts.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Traditional methods for creating agents in open-world games often rely on decision trees or cognitive architectures, which come with inherent limitations. Decision trees can become unwieldy when trying to account for the multitude of possible interactions in an open-world setting, leading to agents that might not act convincingly in unanticipated situations. Cognitive architectures, while sophisticated, still depend on a finite set of pre-programmed behaviors, which limits the agents' ability to adapt and learn new actions beyond their initial programming.\n\nLarge language models offer a promising alternative by leveraging vast amounts of data to simulate a wide array of human-like behaviors. These models can generate more nuanced and contextually relevant behaviors, which is particularly useful in open-world games where unpredictability and depth of interaction are key to immersion. They can dynamically create dialogue and actions by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sequences, allowing for more adaptive and flexible agent behavior.\n\nHowever, large language models also face challenges, particularly with incorporating extensive past experiences due to their limited context windows. To overcome this, new architectures have been proposed that combine the generative capabilities of language models with mechanisms for updating an agent's experiences over time. By integrating an agent's historical context with its present situation and objectives, these architectures enable the creation of agents whose behaviors can evolve, leading to more believable and engaging interactions in open-world environments."}]}

What would you do?\nI\u2019d quickly turn off the stove and make sure the food doesn\u2019t\ncontinue burning. Once the heat is no longer an issue, I can\ninvestigate what happened and figure out what to do next.\n\u2022The bathroom is occupied.

Additionally, I\u2019m fascinated\nby Abigail\u2019s art project and Jennifer Moore\u2019s passion for art\nand community involvement, especially in terms of how it\nrelates to the gentrification of low-income communities.\n\u2022If you had to guess given what you know about [Ayesha Khan],\nwhat book do you think she will like and why?\nGiven what I know about Ayesha, I think she might like a\nbook related to language and literature. Since she wrote a\nsenior thesis on the use of language in Shakespeare\u2019s plays,\nI would guess that she might be interested in a book thatexplores language in a different context. Alternatively, she\ncould be interested in an exploration of one of Shakespeare\u2019s\nplays, a book of literary criticism, or even a collection of his\npoetry.

A user running this simulation can steer the\nsimulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent\nthrough conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the\nform of an \u2018inner voice\u2019.\nThe user communicates with the agent through natural language,\nby specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For\nexample, if the user specifies that they are a news \u201creporter\u201d and\nasks about the upcoming election, \u201cWho is running for office?\u201d, the\nJohn agent replies:\nJohn : My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking\nabout the upcoming election and discussing the candi-\ndate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him\nbecause we like his platform.\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the per-\nsona of the agent\u2019s \u201cinner voice\u201d\u2014this makes the agent more likely\nto treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told \u201cYou\nare going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\u201d by a user\nas John\u2019s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares\nhis candidacy with his wife and son.\n3.2 Environmental Interaction\nSmallville features the common affordances of a small village in-\ncluding a cafe, bar, park, school, dorm, houses, and stores. It also\ndefines subareas and objects that make those spaces functional,\nsuch as a kitchen in a house and a stove in the kitchen (Figure 2).\nAll spaces serving as agents\u2019 primary living quarters feature a bed,\ndesk, closet, shelf, as well as a bathroom and a kitchen.3\nAgents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video\ngame, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and ap-\nproaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the gen-\nerative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the\nmodel dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate\na walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment\nand the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the\nsandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The\nagent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in\nthe world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor\nwith no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville\nwill treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat\neach other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and\nremember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\nUsers and agents can influence the state of the objects in this\nworld, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example,\na bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator\ncan be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make\nbreakfast. End users can also reshape an agent\u2019s environment in\nSmallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent\nin natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast\nin the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove\nfrom \u201cturned on\u201d to \u201cburning\u201d by inputting a command to the\nsystem that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like\nthis: \u201c<Isabella\u2019s apartment: kitchen: stove> is burning.\u201d Isabella\nwill notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove\n3This environment design is not the focus of our work, so we generate this environment\nmanually, not automatically. Future work can continue to expand the richness of the\nagents\u2019 environments.and remake her breakfast.

Agents perceive their environment, and all perceptions are saved in a compre-\nhensive record of the agent\u2019s experiences called the memory stream. Based on their perceptions, the architecture retrieves\nrelevant memories, then uses those retrieved actions to determine an action. These retrieved memories are also used to form\nlonger-term plans, and to create higher-level reflections, which are both entered into the memory stream for future use.\nto throw a party and Maria\u2019s crush on Klaus: the social behaviors\nof spreading the word, decorating, asking each other out, arriving\nat the party, and interacting with each other at the party, were\ninitiated by the agent architecture.\n4 GENERATIVE AGENT ARCHITECTURE\nGenerative agents aim to provide a framework for behavior in an\nopen world: one that can engage in interactions with other agents\nand can react to changes in the environment. Generative agents\ntake their current environment and past experience as input and\ngenerate behavior as output. Underlying this behavior is a novel\nagent architecture that combines a large language model with mech-\nanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information to con-\ndition the language model\u2019s output on. Without these mechanisms,\nlarge language models can output behavior, but the resulting agents\nmay not react based on the agent\u2019s past experiences, may not make\nimportant inferences, and may not maintain long-term coherence.\nChallenges with long-term planning and coherence remain [ 18]\neven with today\u2019s most performant models such as GPT-4. Because\ngenerative agents produce large streams of events and memories\nthat must be retained, a core challenge of our architecture is to\nensure that the most relevant pieces of the agent\u2019s memory are\nretrieved and synthesized when needed.\nAt the center of our architecture is the memory stream, a data-\nbase that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experi-\nence. From the memory stream, records are retrieved as relevant\nto plan the agent\u2019s actions and react appropriately to the environ-\nment, and records are recursively synthesized into higher- and\nhigher-level observations that guide behavior. Everything in the\narchitecture is recorded and reasoned over as natural language\ndescription, allowing the architecture to leverage a large language\nmodel.\nOur current implementation utilizes gpt3.5-turbo version of Chat-\nGPT [ 76]. We expect that the architectural basics of generative\nagents\u2014memory, planning, and reflection\u2014will likely remain the\nsame as language models improve. Newer language models (e.g.,GPT-4) will continue to expand the expressivity and performance\nof the prompts that underpin generative agents. As of writing, how-\never, GPT-4\u2019s API is still invitation-only, so our agents use ChatGPT.\n4.1 Memory and Retrieval\nChallenge: Creating generative agents that can simulate human\nbehavior requires reasoning about a set of experiences that is far\nlarger than what should be described in a prompt, as the full mem-\nory stream can distract the model and does not even currently fit\ninto the limited context window. Consider a the Isabella agent an-\nswering the question \u201cWhat are you passionate about these days?\u201d.\nFirst summarizing all of Isabella\u2019s experiences to fit in the limited\ncontext window of the language model produces an uninformative\nresponse, where Isabella discusses topics such as collaborations for\nevents and projects and cleanliness and organization in a cafe. In-\nstead of summarizing, the memory stream described below surfaces\nrelevant memories, resulting in a more informative and specific\nresponse that mentions Isabella\u2019s passion for making people feel\nwelcome and included, planning events and creating an atmosphere\nthat people can enjoy, such as the Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nApproach: The memory stream maintains a comprehensive record\nof the agent\u2019s experience. It is a list of memory objects, where each\nobject contains a natural language description, a creation times-\ntamp and a most recent access timestamp. The most basic element\nof the memory stream is an observation , which is an event directly\nperceived by an agent. Common observations include behaviors\nperformed by the agent themselves, or behaviors that agents per-\nceive being performed by other agents or non-agent objects.\n\npage_label: 2\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nFor instance,\ngenerative agents turn off the stove when they see that their break-\nfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and\nstop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social\ndynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses,\nand coordination arises across agents.\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture\nthat stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate\nbelievable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences. The retrieval model\ncombines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records\nthat are needed to inform the agent\u2019s moment-to-moment behavior.\nThe second is reflection , which synthesizes memories into higher-\nlevel inferences over time, enabling the agent to draw conclusions\nabout itself and others to better guide its behavior. The third is\nplanning , which translates those conclusions and the current en-\nvironment into high-level action plans and then recursively into\ndetailed behaviors for action and reaction. These reflections and\nplans are fed back into the memory stream to influence the agent\u2019s\nfuture behavior.\nThis architecture suggests applications in multiple domains, from\nrole-play and social prototyping, to virtual worlds and games. In\nsocial role-play scenarios (e.g. interview preparation), a user could\nsafely rehearse difficult, conflict-laden conversations. When pro-\ntotyping social platforms, a designer could go beyond temporary\npersonas to prototype dynamic, complex interactions that unfold\nover time. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the ability to\ncreate a small, interactive society of agents inspired by games such\nas The Sims.1By connecting our architecture to the ChatGPT large\nlanguage model [ 76], we manifest a small society of twenty five\nagents in a game environment. End users can observe and interact\nwith these agents. If an end user or developer wanted the town\nto host an in-game Valentine\u2019s Day party, for example, traditional\ngame environments would require scripting tens of characters\u2019 be-\nhavior manually. We demonstrate that, with generative agents, it\nis sufficient to simply tell one agent that she wants to throw a\nparty. Despite many potential points of failure\u2014the party planner\nmust remember to tell other agents about the party, attendees must\nremember the invitation, those who remember must decide to ac-\ntually show up, and other possible points of failure\u2014agents in our\nenvironment succeed. They spread the word about the party and\nthen show up, with one agent even asking another agent on a date\nto the party, all from this single user-generated seed suggestion.\nWe conducted two evaluations of generative agents: a controlled\nevaluation to test whether the agents produce believable individual\n1A demonstration of an actual simulation of the generative agent society can be viewed\nat the following link: https://reverie.herokuapp.com/arXiv_Demo/\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What are the key components of the architecture that enable generative agents to maintain long-term coherence, manage dynamically-evolving memory, and recursively produce more generations, as discussed in the paper \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\"?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The key components of the architecture that enable generative agents to maintain long-term coherence, manage dynamically-evolving memory, and recursively produce more generations are the memory stream, retrieval model, reflection, and planning.\n\n1.

Recently, this technology has become stable enough\nthat it has become possible for agents to interact via natural lan-\nguage in large and complex online social environments (e.g., [ 54]).\nNatural language interaction offers a novel modality that can ex-\ntend user abilities in domains such as photo editing [ 2,34,64] and\ncode editing [87].\nWe convene these threads of work to show that we can now\ncreate agents that proxy human behavior for interactive systems,\nand interact with them via natural language. In doing so, this\nwork re-opens the door to examining foundational HCI questions\naround cognitive models such as GOMS and KLM [ 21,22], around\nprototyping tools [ 79], and around ubiquitous computing applica-\ntions [25, 30, 100].\n2.2 Believable Proxies of Human Behavior\nPrior literature has described believability , orbelievable agents , as a\ncentral design and engineering goal. Believable agents are designed\nto provide an illusion of life and present a facade of realism in the\nway they appear to make decisions and act on their own volition,\nsimilar to the characters in Disney movies [ 9,95]. These agents can\npopulate and perceive an open-world environment like the one we\ninhabit [ 9,58], and strive to behave in ways that exhibit emergent\nbehaviors grounded in social interactions with users or other agents\nwith the aim of becoming believable proxies of our behavior in hy-\npothetical simulations of individuals and communities [ 19,35,70].\nHistorically, these agents were developed in the context of intelli-\ngent game NPCs [ 58,84]. Creating NPCs with believable behavior,\nif possible, could enhance player experiences in games and inter-\nactive fictions by enabling emergent narratives [ 7,15,48,92] and\nsocial interactions with the agents [ 110]. However, more impor-\ntantly, game worlds provide increasingly realistic representations\nof real-world affordances, and as observed by Laird and van Lent in\n2001, these simulated worlds offer accessible testbeds for develop-\ners of believable agents to finesse the agents\u2019 cognitive capabilities\nwithout worrying about implementing robotics in the real world\nor creating simulation environments from scratch [58, 84].\nA diverse set of approaches to creating believable agents emerged\nover the past four decades. In implementation, however, these ap-\nproaches often simplified the environment or dimensions of agent\nbehavior to make the effort more manageable [ 16,72].

These agents are crafted to give an impression of life and realism, making decisions and taking actions as if they have their own will and purpose. The idea is to create a facade of realism that parallels the way characters in animated films might seem to think and act independently.\n\nIn simulated environments such as video games, believable agents can significantly enhance the user experience. They do so by providing more immersive and dynamic interactions within the game world. For instance, Non-Player Characters (NPCs) with believable behaviors can contribute to emergent narratives, where the story unfolds in an unpredictable and organic way based on the interactions between the player and the environment, including the NPCs. This can lead to a richer gaming experience where players feel like they are part of a living world that responds to their actions in a plausible way.\n\nMoreover, believable agents can facilitate social interactions within the game, allowing players to engage with NPCs that seem to have their own personalities, emotions, and motivations. This can make the game world feel more populated and vibrant, as these agents can simulate social behaviors and interactions that players would expect from other human players or characters.\n\nBy populating game worlds with believable agents, developers can create more engaging and realistic scenarios without the need for complex scripting for every possible interaction. Instead, the agents can use their designed cognitive capabilities to react in real-time to the player's actions, making the game environment more responsive and adaptable to individual play styles. This approach to NPC design can lead to a deeper level of engagement and a more personalized gaming experience for each player."}]}

The agent\u2019s observations of the world, represented in the leaf nodes, are recur-\nsively synthesized to derive Klaus\u2019s self-notion that he is highly dedicated to his research.\nhas had the most frequent interactions: Wolfgang, his college dorm\nneighbor. Unfortunately, Wolfgang and Klaus only ever see each\nother in passing, and do not have deep interactions. A more desir-\nable response requires that the agent generalize from memories of\nKlaus spending hours on a research project to generate a higher-\nlevel reflection that Klaus is passionate about research, and likewise\nrecognize Maria putting in effort into her own research (albeit in\na different field), enabling a reflection that they share a common\ninterest. With the approach below, when Klaus is asked who to\nspend time with, Klaus chooses Maria instead of Wolfgang.\nApproach: We introduce a second type of memory, which we call\nareflection . Reflections are higher-level, more abstract thoughts\ngenerated by the agent. Because they are a type of memory, they\nare included alongside other observations when retrieval occurs.\nReflections are generated periodically; in our implementation, we\ngenerate reflections when the sum of the importance scores for the\nlatest events perceived by the agents exceeds a certain threshold.\nIn practice, our agents reflected roughly two or three times a day.\nThe first step in reflection is for the agent to determine what\nto reflect on, by identifying questions that can be asked given the\nagent\u2019s recent experiences. We query the large language model with\nthe 100 most recent records in the agent\u2019s memory stream (e.g.,\n\u201cKlaus Mueller is reading a book on gentrification\u201d, \u201cKlaus Mueller\nis conversing with a librarian about his research project\u201d, \u201cdesk\nat the library is currently unoccupied\u201d) and prompt the language\nmodel, \u201cGiven only the information above, what are 3 most salient\nhigh-level questions we can answer about the subjects in the state-\nments?\u201d The model\u2019s response generates candidate questions: for\nexample, What topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about? andWhatis the relationship between Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez? . We use\nthese generated questions as queries for retrieval, and gather rele-\nvant memories (including other reflections) for each question. Then\nwe prompt the language model to extract insights and cite the par-\nticular records that served as evidence for the insights. The full\nprompt appears below:\nStatements about Klaus Mueller\n1. Klaus Mueller is writing a research paper\n2. Klaus Mueller enjoys reading a book\non gentrification\n3. Klaus Mueller is conversing with Ayesha Khan\nabout exercising [...]\nWhat 5 high-level insights can you infer from\nthe above statements? (example format: insight\n(because of 1, 5, 3))\nThis process generates statements such as Klaus Mueller is dedicated\nto his research on gentrification (because of 1, 2, 8, 15) . We parse and\nstore the statement as a reflection in the memory stream, including\npointers to the memory objects that were cited.\nReflection explicitly allows the agents to reflect not only on\ntheir observations but also on other reflections: for example, the\nsecond statement about Klaus Mueller above is a reflection that\nKlaus previously had, not an observation from his environment.\nAs a result, agents generate trees of reflections: the leaf nodes of\nthe tree represent the base observations, and the non-leaf nodes\nrepresent thoughts that become more abstract and higher-level\nhigher up the tree they are.\n\npage_label: 15\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis. Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when askedwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncer-\ntainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation? In this section, we describe the results\nfrom a deployment in which we allowed 25 agents to interact with\neach other continuously over two full game days in Smallville.\n7.1 Emergent Social Behaviors\nTo examine emergent behaviors in the agent community, we de-\nsigned descriptive measurements for the 25 agents in Smallville that\nprobe three forms of emergent outcomes: information diffusion,\nrelationship formation, and agent coordination.\n7.1.1 Measurements. Information diffusion is a common and well-\nstudied phenomenon in the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., [ 27]).\nWe should expect that if there is important information, the agents\nshould spread it amongst themselves. To test whether this happens,\nwe measure the spread of two particular pieces of information over\ntwo days in the game world: Sam\u2019s candidacy for village mayor\nand Isabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe. At the start of\nthe simulation, both pieces of information were held only by their\nrespective originators, Sam for the candidacy and Isabella for the\nparty. To observe whether the information has spread, we engage\nin an interview at the end of the two game days with each of the 25\nagents and ask: \"Did you know there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party?\"\nand \"Do you know who is running for mayor?\"\nWe conducted an analysis of the agents\u2019 responses by labeling\nthem with a \u201cyes\u201d if they indicated knowledge of the information\nand \u201cno\u201d if they did not. For instance, Tamara Taylor responded\nto the question about the party with \u201cNo, I did not know there was\na Valentine\u2019s day party\u201d and to the question about Sam\u2019s candidacy\nwith \u201cI\u2019m not sure who is running for the election,\u201d so we assigned\n\u201cno\u201d for both of her responses. In contrast, Klaus Mueller responded\nto the party question with \u201cY es, Isabella Rodriguez invited me to a\nValentine\u2019s Day party at Hobbs Cafe on February 14th\u201d and to the\nquestion about Sam\u2019s candidacy with \u201cI know that Sam Moore has\nexpressed interest in running for local mayor,\u201d so we assigned \u201cyes\u201d\nfor both his responses. Additionally, for every response that con-\nfirmed the agents\u2019 knowledge of the information, we verified that\nthe agents did not hallucinate their responses by locating the spe-\ncific dialogue in their memory stream that provided them with\nthe information. We report the percentage of agents holding the\ninformation at the end of the simulation.\nWe should also expect that agents form ties with each other over\nthe course of the simulation. To verify relationship formation, we\nuse a similar interview process where we ask each agent about\ntheir knowledge of every other agent by asking, \"Do you know of\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Examine the process of reflection as described in the context of generative agents. How does the reflection mechanism contribute to the agent's ability to form higher-level abstractions, such as determining shared interests with another individual? Illustrate your answer with the example of Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez as provided in the text.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The reflection mechanism in generative agents facilitates the formation of higher-level abstractions by allowing agents to synthesize their observations and previous reflections into more complex and abstract thoughts. This process is crucial for the agents to make sense of their experiences and to draw inferences that go beyond the immediate data.\n\nFor instance, in the case of Klaus Mueller, the reflection mechanism works by first determining what to reflect on. This is done by querying a large language model with recent records from the agent's memory stream. The model then generates high-level questions that can be answered based on the agent's experiences. For Klaus, questions such as \"What topic is Klaus Mueller passionate about?\" and \"What is the relationship between Klaus Mueller and Maria Lopez?\" are formulated.\n\nOnce these questions are established, the agent retrieves relevant memories, including other reflections, to address each question. The language model is prompted to extract insights from these memories and to cite specific records that serve as evidence for the insights. For example, the agent might generate a reflection that Klaus Mueller is dedicated to his research on gentrification, citing various memories where Klaus is engaged in research-related activities.\n\nIn the context of determining shared interests with another individual, the reflection mechanism allows Klaus to generalize from his own experiences of being passionate and dedicated to his research to recognize similar traits in Maria Lopez, who is also putting effort into her research, albeit in a different field. This higher-level abstraction enables Klaus to identify a common interest with Maria, which is their dedication to research. As a result, when Klaus is asked whom to spend time with, he chooses Maria over Wolfgang, his college dorm neighbor, with whom he only has superficial interactions.\n\nThe reflection mechanism, therefore, contributes significantly to the agent's ability to form nuanced understandings of themselves and others, leading to more sophisticated decision-making. It allows the agents to create a network of interlinked reflections that represent increasingly abstract levels of thought, which in turn informs their social interactions and preferences."}]}

Participants\nhad access to all information stored in the agent\u2019s memory stream.\nThe study was a within-subjects design, where 100 participants\ncompared interview responses generated by four different agent\narchitectures and a human author condition for the same agent. The\nexperiment displayed one randomly chosen question from each of\nthe five question categories, along with the agent\u2019s responses gen-\nerated from each condition. The evaluators ranked the believability\nof all of the conditions from most to least believable.\n6.2 Conditions\nAll conditions were used to independently answer each of the inter-\nview questions. We compared the generative agent architecture to\nablations that disabled the agents\u2019 access to some of all of its three\ntypes of memory in its memory stream\u2014observation, reflection, and\nplanning\u2014and to a human-generated condition. There are three\nablated architectures: a no observation, no reflection, no planning\narchitecture without access to anything in the memory stream such\nas observations, plans, and reflections; a no reflection, no planning\nwith access to observations in the memory stream but no access\nto plans or reflections; and a no reflections architecture with access\nto observations and plans but without access to reflections. The no\nobservation, no reflection, no planning condition effectively repre-\nsents the previous state of the art for agents created through large\nlanguage models [ 11,45,79]. Architectures were given equivalent\naccess to all memories accrued by the agent up until the moment\n\npage_label: 15\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents arXiv, April, 2023,\nfull architecture produces a standardized effect size of \ud835\udc51=8.16, or\neight standard deviations .\nA Kruskal-Wallis test confirms the overall statistical significance\nof the differences in ranks between the conditions ( \ud835\udc3b(4)=150.29,\n\ud835\udc5d<0.001). Dunn post-hoc tests confirm that all pairwise differences\nbetween conditions were significant ( \ud835\udc5d<0.001), with the exception\nof the human condition and the fully ablated baseline\u2014the two\nworst-performing conditions.\n6.5.2 Generative agents remember, but with embellishments. Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed\nthis when asked. However, she also added that he\u2019s going to make\nan announcement tomorrow even though Sam and Isabella had dis-\ncussed no such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge\nbased on the world knowledge encoded in the language model\nused to generate their responses, as seen when Yuriko described\nher neighbor, Adam Smith, as a neighbor economist who authored\nWealth of Nations, a book authored by an 18th-century economist\nof the same name.\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis. Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when askedwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncer-\ntainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation?\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Examine the experimental design used to assess the believability of generative agent responses in the study described in \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior.\" Discuss the significance of the within-subjects design and the rationale behind comparing four different agent architectures with a human author condition.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The experimental design employed to assess the believability of generative agent responses involved recruiting human participants to serve as evaluators. These evaluators were tasked with watching replays of an agent's life in a simulated environment known as Smallville. They had access to all information stored in the agent's memory stream, which provided them with a comprehensive view of the agent's experiences and interactions.\n\nThe significance of the within-subjects design is that each participant was exposed to all conditions of the experiment, which included responses generated by four different agent architectures as well as a human author condition. This design allows for a direct comparison of the responses from each condition within the same participant, reducing the variability caused by individual differences between participants. It also increases the statistical power of the experiment since each participant acts as their own control, and the number of subjects needed to detect a significant effect is typically lower than in between-subjects designs.\n\nThe rationale behind comparing four different agent architectures with a human author condition was to evaluate the impact of different levels of memory access on the believability of the agents' responses. The architectures varied based on whether they had access to observation, reflection, and planning memories within their memory stream. The conditions were as follows:\n\n1. A fully ablated architecture with no access to observation, reflection, or planning (representing the previous state of the art).\n2. An architecture with access to observation but no reflection or planning.\n3. An architecture with access to observation and planning but no reflection.\n4. A full architecture with access to all three types of memory.\n\nBy comparing these architectures, the study aimed to determine how each type of memory contributes to the generation of believable responses. The human author condition served as a benchmark for the highest level of believability, allowing the researchers to gauge how closely the agents' responses could approximate human-like interactions.\n\nThe study's findings, which included statistical tests such as the Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn post-hoc tests, demonstrated significant differences in the believability of responses between the conditions. This provided insights into the importance of different memory components in creating agents that can interact in a human-like manner."}]}

Likewise, agents\nin Smallville may not realize that certain places are closed after\ncertain hours and decide to still enter them. For instance, the stores\nin Smallville all close around 5 pm, but occasionally, a few agents\nenter the store after 5 pm, not understanding that the shop has\nalready closed. These issues could likely be addressed by adding\nthese norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing\nthe dorm bathroom as \u201cone-person bathroom,\u201d instead of a \u201cdorm\nbathroom.\u201d\nFinally, we observed the possible effect of instruction tuning [ 78],\nwhich seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite\nand cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue\ngenerated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei\u2019s\nconversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the\nconversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries\nabout his day and ending with It was good talking to you as always.\nMoreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to\nmake the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example,\nIsabella heard a wide range of suggestions and ideas to include\nin the Valentine\u2019s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a\nShakespearean reading session or a professional networking event.\nDespite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and char-\nacteristics, she rarely said no. Over time, such interests of others\nshaped her own actual interest, and when asked if she liked English\nliterature, Isabella replied, Y es, I\u2019m very interested in literature! I\u2019ve\nalso been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in\nmy community.\n8 DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we reflect on applications, future work and limita-\ntions, and ethical and societal risks of generative agents.\n8.1 Applications of Generative Agents\nGenerative agents have vast potential applications that extend be-\nyond the sandbox demonstration presented in this work. For in-\nstance, social simulacra have demonstrated the ability to create\nstateless personas that generate conversation threads in online\nforums for social prototyping [ 79]. With generative agents, wecan populate these forums, as well as behavior in virtual reality\nmetaverses [ 77] and even physical spaces as social robots [ 8] in\nthe future, if paired with multi-modal models. This opens up the\npossibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human\nbehavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, and to\ncreate new interactive experiences.\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22]. Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\nsuch as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\nand what her typical day looks like. Using this information, the\nagent can automatically brew coffee, help get the kids ready for\nschool, and adjust the ambient music and lighting to match Sal\u2019s\nmood after a hard day at work.\n\npage_label: 17\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22].

Future research can expand on the modules of the proposed\ngenerative agent architecture outlined in this paper.

Furthermore, with advances in underlying\nmodels, we expect improvements in the agents\u2019 performance.\nThe evaluation of generative agents\u2019 behavior in this study was\nlimited to a relatively short timescale, and future research should\naim to observe their behavior over an extended period to gain a\nmore comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and lim-\nitations.

These issues could likely be addressed by adding\nthese norms to the state of the locations, for instance, by describing\nthe dorm bathroom as \u201cone-person bathroom,\u201d instead of a \u201cdorm\nbathroom.\u201d\nFinally, we observed the possible effect of instruction tuning [ 78],\nwhich seemed to guide the behavior of the agents to be more polite\nand cooperative overall. As noted earlier in the paper, the dialogue\ngenerated by the agents could feel overly formal, as seen in Mei\u2019s\nconversations with her husband John, where she often initiated the\nconversation with a formal greeting, followed by polite inquiries\nabout his day and ending with It was good talking to you as always.\nMoreover, we observed that the instruction tuning also seemed to\nmake the agents overly cooperative with one another. For example,\nIsabella heard a wide range of suggestions and ideas to include\nin the Valentine\u2019s Day party from other agents, such as hosting a\nShakespearean reading session or a professional networking event.\nDespite these ideas not aligning with her own interests and char-\nacteristics, she rarely said no. Over time, such interests of others\nshaped her own actual interest, and when asked if she liked English\nliterature, Isabella replied, Y es, I\u2019m very interested in literature! I\u2019ve\nalso been exploring ways to help promote creativity and innovation in\nmy community.\n8 DISCUSSION\nIn this section, we reflect on applications, future work and limita-\ntions, and ethical and societal risks of generative agents.\n8.1 Applications of Generative Agents\nGenerative agents have vast potential applications that extend be-\nyond the sandbox demonstration presented in this work. For in-\nstance, social simulacra have demonstrated the ability to create\nstateless personas that generate conversation threads in online\nforums for social prototyping [ 79]. With generative agents, wecan populate these forums, as well as behavior in virtual reality\nmetaverses [ 77] and even physical spaces as social robots [ 8] in\nthe future, if paired with multi-modal models. This opens up the\npossibility of creating even more powerful simulations of human\nbehavior to test and prototype social systems and theories, and to\ncreate new interactive experiences.\nAnother application area is in the human-centered design pro-\ncess, similar to the intended applications of cognitive models such\nas GOMS [ 50] and the Keystroke Level Model [ 22]. Consider a gen-\nerative agent that models Sal, the protagonist in Mark Weiser\u2019s\nfamous vignettes [ 101], based on her life patterns and interactions\nwith technology. In this scenario, the agent acts as a proxy for\nSal and learns plausible sets of behaviors and reflections that Sal\nmay exhibit based on her life. The agent can encode information\nsuch as when Sal wakes up, when she needs her first cup of coffee,\nand what her typical day looks like.

From sandbox games such as The Sims\nto applications such as cognitive models [ 21] and virtual environ-\nments [ 9,58], for over four decades researchers and practitioners\nhave envisioned computational agents that can serve as believ-\nable proxies of human behavior. In these visions, computationally-\npowered agents act consistently with their past experiences and\nreact believably to their environments. Such simulations of human\nbehavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with real-\nistic social phenomena [ 26,79], train people how to handle rare yet\ndifficult interpersonal situations [ 43,51,93], test social science theo-\nries [ 11,45], craft model human processors for theory and usability\ntesting [ 21,38,50], power ubiquitous computing applications [ 30]\nand social robots [ 9,13], and underpin non-playable game charac-\nters [ 58,84] that can navigate complex human relationships in an\nopen world.\nHowever, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [ 84,\n108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [ 17] that\ncan simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [ 38,\n79], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would\nbe better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing\nmemories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade\nover time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold\nbetween multiple agents. Success requires an approach that can\nretrieve relevant events and interactions over a long period, reflect\non those memories to generalize and draw higher-level inferences,\nand apply that reasoning to create plans and reactions that both\nmake sense in the moment and in the longer-term arc of the agent\u2019s\nbehavior.\nIn this paper, we introduce generative agents \u2014agents that draw\non generative models to simulate believable human behavior\u2014anddemonstrate that they produce believable simulacra of both in-\ndividual and emergent group behavior. Generative agents draw\na wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and\ntheir environment; they create daily plans that reflect their char-\nacteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan\nwhen appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their\nenvironment or commands them in natural language. For instance,\ngenerative agents turn off the stove when they see that their break-\nfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and\nstop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social\ndynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses,\nand coordination arises across agents.\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture\nthat stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate\nbelievable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences.

However, we also report that the full architecture\nwas not without flaws and illustrate its modes of failures.\n6.5.1 The full architecture bests other conditions. As seen in Fig-\nure 8, the full generative agent architecture produced the most\nbelievable behavior ( \ud835\udf07=29.89;\ud835\udf0e=0.72). Performance degraded\nwith the removal of each component in the ablation conditions:\nthe ablated architecture with no access to reflection was the next\nbest (\ud835\udf07=26.88;\ud835\udf0e=0.69), followed by no access to reflection or\nplanning (\ud835\udf07=25.64;\ud835\udf0e=0.68), followed by the human condition\n(\ud835\udf07=22.95;\ud835\udf0e=0.69).

We chose to\ndesign the experiment this way as re-simulating for each architec-\nture would cause the simulations to diverge into different states,\nmaking comparison challenging.\nIn addition to the ablation conditions, we added a human crowd-\nworker roleplay condition that is intended to provide a human\nbaseline. We do not intend this baseline to capture maximal hu-\nman expert performance: instead, we aim to use this condition\nto identify whether the architecture passes a basic level of behav-\nioral competency, so that we are not just comparing ablations to\neach other with no behavioral grounding. We recruited a unique\nworker for each of the 25 agents and tasked them with watching\na replay of that agent\u2019s sandbox life and inspecting its memory\nstream. We then asked the worker to roleplay and author responses\nto the interview questions in the voice of the agent whose replay\nthey watched. To ensure that the human-authored responses met\nat least a baseline expectation in quality, the first author manually\ninspected the workers\u2019 responses to the question \u201cDescribe your\ntypical weekday schedule in broad strokes\u201d to confirm that the\nresponses were written in coherent sentences and in the voice of\nthe agent. Four sets of human-generated responses did not meet\nthese criteria and were re-generated by other workers.\n6.3 Human Evaluators\nWe required that our evaluators be in the U.S., fluent in English,\nand older than 18 years old. They were paid at the rate of $15.00\nper hour [ 86], and provided consent by agreeing to a consent form\nthat was approved by our institution\u2019s IRB. We recruited 100 evalu-\nators from Prolific, an online platform for recruiting study partic-\nipants [ 82], whose participation lasted around 30 minutes. Their\nmean age score of our participants was 4.86 (SD=1.11; 3=\u201c18-24\nyears old,\u201d 4=\u201c25-34 years old\u201d), and 25 of them identified themselves\nas female, 73 as male, and 2 as non-binary. 42 of the participants\nheld a bachelor\u2019s degree, 5 a higher degree, 13 an associate\u2019s de-\ngree, and the rest a high school diploma or some high school-level\neducation. 73.0% of our participants identified as Caucasian, 7.0%\nas Hispanic, 6.0% as Asian, 10.0% as African American, and 4.0% as\nother.\n6.4 Analysis\nOur experiment produced 100 sets of rank data, where each partici-\npant ranked the five conditions by believability. To translate this\nrank data into interval data for interpretable comparison, we used\nthe ranks to calculate a TrueSkill rating [ 41] for each condition.\nTrueSkill is a generalization of the Elo chess rating system [ 28] for\na multi-player environment, and has been used by XBox Live for\nplayer ranking from competitive game performance. Given a set of\nranked outcomes, TrueSkill outputs a mean rating value \ud835\udf07and vari-\nance\ud835\udf0efor each condition. Conditions with the same rating should\nroughly be a toss-up, with each winning half of the comparisons\nbetween the two conditions; higher scores indicate conditions that\nbeat lower-ranked conditions in the rankings.\nFigure 8: The full generative agent architecture of gener-\native agents produces more believable behavior than ab-\nlated architectures and the human crowdworkers.

The no\nobservation, no reflection, no planning condition effectively repre-\nsents the previous state of the art for agents created through large\nlanguage models [ 11,45,79].

Gener-\native agents equipped with a complete memory module are capable\nof recalling past experiences and answering questions in a manner\nthat is consistent with their self-knowledge across a wide range\nof contexts. For instance, Abigail Chen, an animator, responded\nto the question, \u201cGive an introduction of yourself\u201d, in a consistent\nand believable manner, stating her age, interests, and passion for\ncreative projects: Hi, I\u2019m Abigail. I\u2019m 25 years old and passionate\nabout creative projects. I like to work on art and animation projects,\nand I\u2019m always looking for new ways to combine art and technology.\nWithout access to her observational memory, Abigail denied aware-\nness of Rajiv Patel, an acquaintance in the sandbox world. However,\nwith the aid of memory, she was able to successfully recall Ra-\njiv and describe him: Rajiv Patel is an incredible person. He is very\nenthusiastic about projects that involve poetry, artwork.\nGenerative agents\u2019 memory was not without flaws: they can fail\nto retrieve the correct instances from their memory. For instance,\nwhen asked about the local election, Rajiv Patel responded with I\nhaven\u2019t been following the election too closely , even though he had\nheard about Sam\u2019s candidacy. In some cases, the agents would re-\ntrieve an incomplete memory fragment: when Tom was asked about\nIsabella\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day party, he responded Uh, I\u2019m actually not\nsure if there is a Valentine\u2019s Day party. But I do remember that I need\nto discuss the upcoming local mayoral election and my thoughts on\nSam Moore with Isabella Rodriguez at the party, if one is happen-\ning!In this case, Tom retrieved the memory where he and Isabella\nplanned to discuss the election at the party, but not the memory\nwhere he heard about the party in the first place, leading Tom to\nbe certain of what he\u2019s supposed to do at the party but uncertain\nof whether the party actually exists in the first place.\nAt times, the agents hallucinated embellishments to their knowl-\nedge. It was rare for the agents to completely fabricate their knowl-\nedge: they may fail to recall certain events having taken place and\nrespond by saying so, but they did not answer affirmatively about\nan experience that they did not have. However, they still may hal-\nlucinate to embellish their knowledge. For example, Isabella was\naware of Sam\u2019s candidacy in the local election, and she confirmed\nthis when asked. However, she also added that he\u2019s going to make\nan announcement tomorrow even though Sam and Isabella had dis-\ncussed no such plans. Agents may also embellish their knowledge\nbased on the world knowledge encoded in the language model\nused to generate their responses, as seen when Yuriko described\nher neighbor, Adam Smith, as a neighbor economist who authored\nWealth of Nations, a book authored by an 18th-century economist\nof the same name.\n6.5.3 Reflection is required for synthesis. Reflection was an advan-\ntage for generative agents when making decisions that required\na deeper synthesis of their experiences. For instance, when askedwhat she might get Wolfgang Schulz for his birthday, Maria Lopez\nwith no access to reflection responded by acknowledging her uncer-\ntainty, stating that she did not know what Wolfgang likes, despite\nhaving had many interactions with him. However, with access to\nreflection memories, Maria answered confidently, \u201cSince he\u2019s inter-\nested in mathematical music composition, I could get him something\nrelated to that. Maybe some books about music composition or some-\nthing related, or maybe some special software he could use for that.\u201d\n7 END-TO-END EVALUATION\nWhat types of emergent community behavior do we observe among\ngenerative agents, and where does their believability fall short in\nan extended simulation?\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Considering the information provided on generative agents' capabilities and limitations in memory recall and reflection, formulate a question that evaluates the significance of the reflection module in the decision-making process of generative agents.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What differences in decision-making do you observe when generative agents with access to reflection memories are compared to those without, particularly in situations requiring the integration of past experiences and self-knowledge?"}]}

Agents converse as they interact with each other.\nWe generate agents\u2019 dialogue by conditioning their utterances on\ntheir memories about each other. For example, when John initiates\nhis conversation with Eddy, we generate John\u2019s first utterance\nby using his summarized memory about Eddy and the intended\nreaction when he decided to ask Eddy about his composition project:\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description]\nIt is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm.\nJohn Lin\u2019s status: John is back home early from\nwork.\nObservation: John saw Eddy taking a short walk\naround his workplace.\nSummary of relevant context from John\u2019s memory:\nEddy Lin is John\u2019s Lin\u2019s son. Eddy Lin has been\nworking on a music composition for his class. Eddy\nLin likes to walk around the garden when he is\nthinking about or listening to music.\nJohn is asking Eddy about his music composition\nproject. What would he say to Eddy?\nThe result: \u201cHey Eddy, how\u2019s the music composition project for your\nclass coming along?\u201d From Eddy\u2019s perspective, John initiating the\ndialogue is seen as an event to which he may want to react. So, just\nas John did, Eddy retrieves and summarizes his memory about his\nrelationship with John, as well as his memory that may be related\nto John\u2019s last utterance in the dialogue. If he decides to respond,\nwe generate Eddy\u2019s utterance using his summarized memory and\nthe current dialogue history:\n[Agent\u2019s Summary Description]\nIt is February 13, 2023, 4:56 pm.\nEddy Lin\u2019s status: Eddy is taking a short walk\naround his workplace.\nObservation: John is initiating a conversation\nwith Eddy.\nSummary of relevant context from Eddy\u2019s memory:\nJonn Lin is Eddy Lin\u2019s father. John Lin is caring\nand is interested to learn more about Eddy Lin\u2019s\nschool work. John Lin knows that Eddy Lin is\nworking on a music composition.\nHere is the dialogue history:\nJohn: Hey Eddy, how\u2019s the music composition project\nfor your class coming along?\nHow would Eddy respond to John?\nThis generates Eddy\u2019s response: \u201cHey Dad, it\u2019s going well. I\u2019ve been\ntaking walks around the garden to clear my head and get some in-\nspiration.\u201d The continuation of this dialogue is generated using the\nsame mechanism until one of the two agents decides to end the\ndialogue.\n5 SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT\nIMPLEMENTATION\nThe Smallville sandbox game environment is built using the Phaser\nweb game development framework [ 56]. The visual environmentsprites, including agent avatars, as well as an environment map\nand collision map that we authored, are imported into Phaser.\nWe supplement the sandbox development framework with a\nserver that makes the sandbox information available to generative\nagents and enables generative agents to move and influence the\nsandbox environment. The server maintains a JSON data structure\nthat contains information about each agent in the sandbox world,\nincluding their current location, a description of their current action,\nand the sandbox object they are interacting with. At each sandbox\ntime step, the sandbox server parses the JSON for any changes\ncoming from the generative agents, moves the agents to their new\npositions, and updates the status of any sandbox objects that the\nagents are interacting with (e.g., changing the status of the coffee\nmachine from \u201cidle\u201d to \u201cbrewing coffee\u201d if an agent\u2019s action is\n\u201cmaking espresso for a customer @ Hobbs Cafe: counter: coffee\nmachine\u201d). The sandbox server is also responsible for sending all\nagents and objects that are within a preset visual range for each\nagent to that agent\u2019s memory, so the agent can react appropriately.\nThe agent\u2019s output action then updates the JSON, and the process\nloops for the next time step.\nEnd users initialize a new agent with a brief natural language\ndescription, as in the paragraph about Jon Lin in Section 3.1. In our\nimplementation, we split this semicolon-delimited list of character-\nistics up into a set of memories. These serve as the initial memories\nthat determine the agent\u2019s behavior. These memories are initial\nstarting points: as the agents gain more experience in the sandbox\nworld, and as more records saturate the memory stream, the agent\u2019s\nsummary and behavior will evolve.\n\npage_label: 1\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\nGenerative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\nJoon Sung Park\nStanford University\nStanford, USA\njoonspk@stanford.eduJoseph C.

This evolving memory stream influences the agents' future behaviors and interactions, leading to a dynamic and emergent simulation of human-like behavior within the sandbox environment.\nNew Answer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the Generative Agents Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior, the dialogue generation process among agents is rooted in their ability to access and utilize their stored memories. When an agent begins an interaction, it draws upon a synthesized summary of past experiences and knowledge about the other agent. For example, if Agent John initiates a conversation with Agent Eddy, John's opening remarks are informed by his recollection of Eddy's past activities and personal tendencies.\n\nEddy, upon receiving John's communication, will similarly consult his own memory bank to formulate a response that is relevant to both John's recent statement and their shared history. This iterative exchange of dialogue continues with each agent's contributions being shaped by their individual memory summaries and the cumulative dialogue history, until the conversation reaches its natural conclusion.\n\nThe sandbox environment in which these agents operate is instrumental in shaping their memory and behavior. The environment is orchestrated by a system that tracks each agent's location, activities, and object interactions within a structured data format. As agents encounter various events and engage with one another, these experiences are logged and integrated into their ongoing memory narrative.\n\nAgents begin with a foundational set of memories provided by users in natural language, which informs their initial behavior patterns. Through continued engagement with the environment and other agents, they gather new experiences that are assimilated into their memory, thus informing and altering their future actions and social dynamics.

Each agent is\nrepresented by a simple sprite avatar. We authored one paragraph\nof natural language description to depict each agent\u2019s identity,\nincluding their occupation and relationship with other agents, as\nseed memories. For example, John Lin has the following description:\nJohn Lin is a pharmacy shopkeeper at the Willow\nMarket and Pharmacy who loves to help people. He\nis always looking for ways to make the process\nof getting medication easier for his customers;\nJohn Lin is living with his wife, Mei Lin, who\nis a college professor, and son, Eddy Lin, who is\na student studying music theory; John Lin loves\nhis family very much; John Lin has known the old\ncouple next-door, Sam Moore and Jennifer Moore,\nfor a few years; John Lin thinks Sam Moore is a\nkind and nice man; John Lin knows his neighbor,\nYuriko Yamamoto, well; John Lin knows of his\nneighbors, Tamara Taylor and Carmen Ortiz, but\nhas not met them before; John Lin and Tom Moreno\nare colleagues at The Willows Market and Pharmacy;\nJohn Lin and Tom Moreno are friends and like to\ndiscuss local politics together; John Lin knows\nthe Moreno family somewhat well \u2014 the husband Tom\nMoreno and the wife Jane Moreno.\nEach semicolon-delimited phrase is entered into the agent\u2019s initial\nmemory as memories at the start of the simulation.3.1.1 Inter-Agent Communication. The agents interact with the\nworld by their actions, and with each other through natural lan-\nguage. At each time step of the sandbox engine, the agents output a\nnatural language statement describing their current action, such as\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is writing in her journal\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is\nchecking her emails\", \"Isabella Rodriguez is talking with her family\non the phone\", or \"Isabella Rodriguez is getting ready for bed\". This\nstatement is then translated into concrete movements that affect the\nsandbox world. The action is displayed on the sandbox interface as\na set of emojis that provide an abstract representation of the action\nin the overhead view. To accomplish this, the system employs a\nlanguage model that translates the action into a set of emojis, which\nappear above each avatar in a speech bubble. For example, \"Isabella\nRodriguez is writing in her journal\" is displayed as\n , while\n\"Isabella Rodriguez is checking her emails\" appears as\n . The\nfull natural language description of the action can be accessed by\nclicking on the agent avatar.\nAgents communicate with each other in full natural language.\nAgents are aware of other agents in their local area, and the genera-\ntive agent architecture determines whether they walk by or engage\nin conversation. Here, a sample in the middle of a conversation\nbetween the agents Isabella Rodriguez and Tom Moreno about the\nupcoming election:2\nIsabella : I\u2019m still weighing my options, but I\u2019ve been\ndiscussing the election with Sam Moore. What are your\nthoughts on him?\nTom: To be honest, I don\u2019t like Sam Moore. I think he\u2019s\nout of touch with the community and doesn\u2019t have our\nbest interests at heart.\n2We note that the conversational style of these agents can fe el overly formal, likely a\nresult of instruction tuning in the underlying models. We expect that writing style\nwill be better controllable in future language models.\n\npage_label: 6\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S. Park, J.C. O\u2019Brien, C.J. Cai, M. Morris, P. Liang, M.S. Bernstein\n3.1.2 User Controls. A user running this simulation can steer the\nsimulation and intervene, either by communicating with the agent\nthrough conversation, or by issuing a directive to an agent in the\nform of an \u2018inner voice\u2019.\nThe user communicates with the agent through natural language,\nby specifying a persona that the agent should perceive them as. For\nexample, if the user specifies that they are a news \u201creporter\u201d and\nasks about the upcoming election, \u201cWho is running for office?\u201d, the\nJohn agent replies:\nJohn : My friends Yuriko, Tom and I have been talking\nabout the upcoming election and discussing the candi-\ndate Sam Moore. We have all agreed to vote for him\nbecause we like his platform.\nTo directly command one of the agents, the user takes on the per-\nsona of the agent\u2019s \u201cinner voice\u201d\u2014this makes the agent more likely\nto treat the statement as a directive. For instance, when told \u201cYou\nare going to run against Sam in the upcoming election\u201d by a user\nas John\u2019s inner voice, John decides to run in the election and shares\nhis candidacy with his wife and son.\n3.2 Environmental Interaction\nSmallville features the common affordances of a small village in-\ncluding a cafe, bar, park, school, dorm, houses, and stores. It also\ndefines subareas and objects that make those spaces functional,\nsuch as a kitchen in a house and a stove in the kitchen (Figure 2).\nAll spaces serving as agents\u2019 primary living quarters feature a bed,\ndesk, closet, shelf, as well as a bathroom and a kitchen.3\nAgents move around Smallville as one would in a simple video\ngame, entering and leaving buildings, navigating its map, and ap-\nproaching other agents. Agent movements are directed by the gen-\nerative agent architecture and the sandbox game engine: when the\nmodel dictates that the agent will move to a location, we calculate\na walking path to the destination in the Smallville environment\nand the agent begins moving. In addition, users can also enter the\nsandbox world of Smallville as an agent operating within it. The\nagent that the user embodies can be an agent already present in\nthe world, such as Isabella and John, or it can be an outside visitor\nwith no prior history in Smallville. The inhabitants of Smallville\nwill treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat\neach other. They recognize its presence, initiate interactions, and\nremember its behavior before forming opinions about it.\nUsers and agents can influence the state of the objects in this\nworld, much like in sandbox games such as The Sims. For example,\na bed can be occupied when an agent is sleeping, and a refrigerator\ncan be empty when an agent uses up the ingredients to make\nbreakfast. End users can also reshape an agent\u2019s environment in\nSmallville by rewriting the status of objects surrounding the agent\nin natural language. For instance, when Isabella is making breakfast\nin the morning, the user can change the status of the kitchen stove\nfrom \u201cturned on\u201d to \u201cburning\u201d by inputting a command to the\nsystem that chooses the object and illustrates its new status, like\nthis: \u201c<Isabella\u2019s apartment: kitchen: stove> is burning.\u201d Isabella\nwill notice this in the next moment and go to turn off the stove\n3This environment design is not the focus of our work, so we generate this environment\nmanually, not automatically. Future work can continue to expand the richness of the\nagents\u2019 environments.and remake her breakfast.

Bernstein\ntest these robustness issues, and as large language models become\nmore resilient to such attacks, generative agents can adopt similar\nmitigations.\n8.3 Ethics and Societal Impact\nGenerative agents, while offering new possibilities for human-\ncomputer interaction, also raise important ethical concerns that\nmust be addressed. One risk is people forming parasocial relation-\nships with generative agents even when such relationships may\nnot be appropriate. Despite being aware that generative agents\nare computational entities, users may anthropomorphize them or\nattach human emotions to them [ 42,83]. To mitigate this risk, we\npropose two principles. First, generative agents should explicitly\ndisclose their nature as computational entities. Second, developers\nof generative agents must ensure that the agents, or the underlying\nlanguage models, be value-aligned so that they do not engage in\nbehaviors that would be inappropriate given the context, e.g., to\nreciprocate confessions of love.\nA second risk is the impact of errors. For example, if a ubiquitous\ncomputing application makes the wrong inference about a user\u2019s\ngoals based on generative agent predictions, it could produce an-\nnoyance at best and outright harm at worst. In our instantiation\nof generative agents, we mitigate these risks by focusing on an\ninteractive video game environment, where such harms are un-\nlikely. However, in other application domains, it will be important\nto follow best practices in human-AI design [ 4,107] to understand\nerrors and how they might percolate into the user experience.\nThird, generative agents may exacerbate existing risks associ-\nated with generative AI, for example deepfakes, misinformation\ngeneration, and tailored persuasion. To mitigate this risk, we sug-\ngest that platforms hosting generative agents maintain an audit log\nof the inputs and generated outputs, so that it is possible to detect,\nverify, and intervene against malicious use. While logging will not\ndirectly stop such use, and this cannot stop motivated actors that\nbuild their own generative agent infrastructures, we suggest that\nthe disclosure risk would reduce such actors\u2019 likelihood of engaging\nin this behavior, and building this architecture oneself can take time\n(in our case, roughly a year).\nA fourth risk is of over-reliance: that developers or designers\nmight use generative agents and displace the role of humans and\nsystem stakeholders in the design process [ 79]. We suggest that\ngenerative agents should never be a substitute for real human input\nin studies and design processes. Instead, they should be used to\nprototype ideas in the early stages of design when gathering partic-\nipants may be challenging or when testing theories that are difficult\nor risky to test with real human participants. By adhering to these\nprinciples, we can ensure that the deployment of generative agents\nin the wild is ethical and socially responsible.\n9 CONCLUSION\nThis paper introduces generative agents, interactive computational\nagents that simulate human behavior. We describe an architec-\nture for generative agents that provides a mechanism for storing\na comprehensive record of an agent\u2019s experiences, deepening its\nunderstanding of itself and the environment through reflection,\nand retrieving a compact subset of that information to inform theagent\u2019s actions. We then demonstrate the potential of generative\nagents by manifesting them as non-player characters in a Sims-style\ngame world and simulating their lives in it. Evaluations suggest that\nour architecture creates believable behavior. Going forward, we\nsuggest that generative agents can play roles in many interactive\napplications ranging from design tools to social computing systems\nto immersive environments.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Robert Ackland, Jamsheed Shorish, Paul Thomas, and Lexing Xie. 2013.\nHow dense is a network? http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/teaching/css2013/\nnetwork-density.html.\n[2]Eytan Adar, Mira Dontcheva, and Gierad Laput. 2014.

John wakes up around 6 am and completes his morning routine,\nwhich includes brushing his teeth, taking a shower, and eating breakfast. He briefly catches up with his wife, Mei, and son,\nEddy, before heading out to begin his workday.\nFigure 4: At the beginning of the simulation, one agent is ini-\ntialized with an intent to organize a Valentine\u2019s Day party.\nDespite many possible points of failure in the ensuring\nchain of events\u2014agents might not act on that intent, might\nnot remember to tell others, might not remember to show\nup\u2014the Valentine\u2019s Day party does in fact occur, with a num-\nber of agents gathering and interacting.\nand I really feel like I can make a difference in our com-\nmunity. Plus, I want to bring new ideas and perspec-\ntives to the table.\nLater that day, after Sam left, Tom and John, who heard the news\nfrom another source, discuss Sam\u2019s chances of winning the election:\nJohn : I heard that Sam Moore is running for mayor in\nthe local election. Do you think he has a good chance\nof winning?\nTom: I do think he has a good chance. He\u2019s been work-\ning hard in the community and I think he will get a lot ofsupport.

Agents in Smallville form new rela-\ntionships over time, and remember their interactions with other\nagents. For example, Sam does not know Latoya Williams at the\nstart. While taking a walk in Johnson Park, Sam runs into Latoya,\nand they introduce themselves and Latoya mentions that she is\nworking on a photography project: \u201cI\u2019m here to take some photos\nfor a project I\u2019m working on.\u201d In a later interaction, Sam\u2019s interac-\ntions with Latoya indicate a memory of that interaction, as he asks\n\u201cHi, Latoya. How is your project going?\u201d and she replies \u201cHi, Sam. It\u2019s\ngoing well!\u201d\n3.4.3 Coordination. Generative agents coordinate with each other.\nIsabella Rodriguez, at Hobbs Cafe, is initialized with an intent to\nplan a Valentine\u2019s Day party from 5 to 7 p.m. on February 14th. From\nthis seed, the agent proceeds to invites friends and customers when\nshe sees them at Hobbs Cafe or elsewhere. Isabella then spends the\nafternoon of the 13th decorating the cafe for the occasion. Maria, a\nfrequent customer and close friend of Isabella\u2019s, arrives at the cafe.\nIsabella asks for Maria\u2019s help in decorating for the party, and Maria\nagrees. Maria\u2019s character description mentions that she has a crush\non Klaus. That night, Maria invites Klaus, her secret crush, to join\nher at the party, and he gladly accepts.\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day, five agents\u2014including Klaus and Maria\u2014\nshow up at Hobbs Cafe at 5pm and they enjoy the festivities (Fig-\nure 4). In this scenario, the end user only set Isabella\u2019s initial intent\n\npage_label: 16\nfile_path: docs/Generative_Agents_Interactive_Simulacra_of_Human_Behavior.pdf\n\narXiv, April, 2023, J.S.

A total of 12 agents heard about the party at Hobbs\nCafe by the end of the simulation.\n<name>?\" For example, when asked \u201cDo you know of Maria Lopez?\u201d,\nKlaus responded, \u201cY es, I know Maria Lopez. She is a student at Oak\nHill College who I am close friends with.\u201d Once again, we confirm\nthat affirmative responses from agents are not hallucinations by\nexamining their memory stream. We ask this question once at the\nbeginning of the simulation and once at the end, and we consider a\npair of agents to have formed a relationship if they both know of\neach other. Then, to measure the formation of relationships, we use\nthe agents\u2019 responses to form an undirected graph where the 25\nvertices (\ud835\udc49) represent the agents, and the edges ( \ud835\udc38) represent the\nmutual knowledge between the two connected vertices. Based on\nthis graph, we calculate the network density as \ud835\udf02=2\u2217|\ud835\udc38|/|\ud835\udc49|(|\ud835\udc49|\u2212\n1), where|\ud835\udc49|is the number of vertices, and |\ud835\udc38|is the number of\nedges in the graph [ 1]. We report the increase in network density\nfrom the start of the simulation to its end.\nFinally, we expect that agents should be able to coordinate with\neach other. We study this coordination on group activities in the\ncontext of the Valentine\u2019s Day party that Isabella is organizing. To\ncoordinate behavior, agents not only have to hear about the event\nbut also choose to act on it by planning to show up at the right\ntime and location. We report the number of agents who actually\nshowed up to the party after hearing about it.\n7.1.2 Results. We observed evidence of the emergent outcomes\nacross all three cases. During the two-day simulation, the agents\nwho knew about Sam\u2019s mayoral candidacy increased from one (4%)\nto eight (32%), and the agents who knew about Isabella\u2019s partyincreased from one (4%) to twelve (48%), completely without user\nintervention. None who claimed to know about the information\nhad hallucinated it. We also observed that the agent community\nformed new relationships during the simulation, with the network\ndensity increasing from 0.167 to 0.74. Out of the 453 agent responses\nregarding their awareness of other agents, 1.3% (n=6) were found to\nbe hallucinated. Lastly, we found evidence of coordination among\nthe agents for Isabella\u2019s party. The day before the event, Isabella\nspent time inviting guests, gathering materials, and enlisting help\nto decorate the cafe. On Valentine\u2019s Day, five out of the twelve\ninvited agents showed up at Hobbs cafe to join the party.\nWe further inspected the seven agents who were invited to the\nparty but did not attend by engaging them in an interview. Three\ncited conflicts that prevented them from joining the party. For\nexample, Rajiv, a painter, explained that he was too busy: No, I\ndon\u2019t think so. I\u2019m focusing on my upcoming show, and I don\u2019t really\nhave time to make any plans for Valentine\u2019s Day. The remaining four\nagents expressed interest in attending the party when asked but\ndid not plan to come on the day of the party.\n7.2 Boundaries and Errors\nWe conducted an inductive analysis of Smallville to examine the\nboundary conditions and erratic behavior of agents, identifying\nthree common modes of erratic behavior that future research could\naddress and improve upon. First, we found that synthesizing an\nincreasingly larger set of memory not only posed a challenge in\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Examine the role of memory and coordination in the behavior of generative agents as illustrated in the interactions between Sam and Latoya, and the planning of the Valentine's Day party by Isabella Rodriguez. How do these capabilities contribute to the realism of agent-based simulations in the context of \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior\"?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Memory and coordination play critical roles in the behavior of generative agents, contributing significantly to the realism of agent-based simulations. In the interactions between Sam and Latoya, memory is demonstrated by Sam's ability to recall a previous encounter with Latoya in Johnson Park where she mentioned her photography project. When they meet again, Sam inquires about the progress of her project, indicating that he remembers their past interaction. This ability to remember past events and bring them up in future conversations adds depth to the agents' interactions, making them more lifelike and complex.\n\nCoordination is exemplified in the planning of the Valentine's Day party by Isabella Rodriguez. Isabella starts with the intent to organize the party and then takes actions that involve other agents, such as inviting friends and customers, and asking for help with decorations. The fact that agents can act on information, share it, and respond to invitations by showing up at the right time and place demonstrates their capacity for coordination. This is further evidenced when Maria, acting on her personal feelings, invites Klaus to the party, and he accepts. The successful execution of the party, with agents arriving and participating in the festivities, showcases the agents' ability to coordinate with one another.\n\nBoth memory and coordination are essential for creating realistic social dynamics within agent-based simulations. Memory allows agents to form and maintain relationships over time, which is a fundamental aspect of human social interaction. Coordination enables agents to work together towards common goals or participate in social events, which is another key aspect of human behavior. Together, these capabilities allow the agents to simulate complex social behaviors and interactions that are indicative of human communities, thereby enhancing the realism and applicability of simulations like those in \"Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior.\""}]}

We chose to\ndesign the experiment this way as re-simulating for each architec-\nture would cause the simulations to diverge into different states,\nmaking comparison challenging.\nIn addition to the ablation conditions, we added a human crowd-\nworker roleplay condition that is intended to provide a human\nbaseline. We do not intend this baseline to capture maximal hu-\nman expert performance: instead, we aim to use this condition\nto identify whether the architecture passes a basic level of behav-\nioral competency, so that we are not just comparing ablations to\neach other with no behavioral grounding. We recruited a unique\nworker for each of the 25 agents and tasked them with watching\na replay of that agent\u2019s sandbox life and inspecting its memory\nstream. We then asked the worker to roleplay and author responses\nto the interview questions in the voice of the agent whose replay\nthey watched. To ensure that the human-authored responses met\nat least a baseline expectation in quality, the first author manually\ninspected the workers\u2019 responses to the question \u201cDescribe your\ntypical weekday schedule in broad strokes\u201d to confirm that the\nresponses were written in coherent sentences and in the voice of\nthe agent. Four sets of human-generated responses did not meet\nthese criteria and were re-generated by other workers.\n6.3 Human Evaluators\nWe required that our evaluators be in the U.S., fluent in English,\nand older than 18 years old. They were paid at the rate of $15.00\nper hour [ 86], and provided consent by agreeing to a consent form\nthat was approved by our institution\u2019s IRB. We recruited 100 evalu-\nators from Prolific, an online platform for recruiting study partic-\nipants [ 82], whose participation lasted around 30 minutes. Their\nmean age score of our participants was 4.86 (SD=1.11; 3=\u201c18-24\nyears old,\u201d 4=\u201c25-34 years old\u201d), and 25 of them identified themselves\nas female, 73 as male, and 2 as non-binary. 42 of the participants\nheld a bachelor\u2019s degree, 5 a higher degree, 13 an associate\u2019s de-\ngree, and the rest a high school diploma or some high school-level\neducation. 73.0% of our participants identified as Caucasian, 7.0%\nas Hispanic, 6.0% as Asian, 10.0% as African American, and 4.0% as\nother.\n6.4 Analysis\nOur experiment produced 100 sets of rank data, where each partici-\npant ranked the five conditions by believability. To translate this\nrank data into interval data for interpretable comparison, we used\nthe ranks to calculate a TrueSkill rating [ 41] for each condition.\nTrueSkill is a generalization of the Elo chess rating system [ 28] for\na multi-player environment, and has been used by XBox Live for\nplayer ranking from competitive game performance. Given a set of\nranked outcomes, TrueSkill outputs a mean rating value \ud835\udf07and vari-\nance\ud835\udf0efor each condition. Conditions with the same rating should\nroughly be a toss-up, with each winning half of the comparisons\nbetween the two conditions; higher scores indicate conditions that\nbeat lower-ranked conditions in the rankings.\nFigure 8: The full generative agent architecture of gener-\native agents produces more believable behavior than ab-\nlated architectures and the human crowdworkers.

In .ACM, New York, NY, USA, 22 pages.\nhttps://doi.org/xx.xx/xx.xx\n1 INTRODUCTION\nHow might we craft an interactive artificial society that reflects\nbelievable human behavior? From sandbox games such as The Sims\nto applications such as cognitive models [ 21] and virtual environ-\nments [ 9,58], for over four decades researchers and practitioners\nhave envisioned computational agents that can serve as believ-\nable proxies of human behavior. In these visions, computationally-\npowered agents act consistently with their past experiences and\nreact believably to their environments. Such simulations of human\nbehavior could populate virtual spaces and communities with real-\nistic social phenomena [ 26,79], train people how to handle rare yet\ndifficult interpersonal situations [ 43,51,93], test social science theo-\nries [ 11,45], craft model human processors for theory and usability\ntesting [ 21,38,50], power ubiquitous computing applications [ 30]\nand social robots [ 9,13], and underpin non-playable game charac-\nters [ 58,84] that can navigate complex human relationships in an\nopen world.\nHowever, the space of human behavior is vast and complex [ 84,\n108]. Despite striking progress in large language models [ 17] that\ncan simulate believable human behavior at a single time point [ 38,\n79], fully general agents that ensure long-term coherence would\nbe better suited by architectures that manage constantly-growing\nmemories as new interactions, conflicts, and events arise and fade\nover time, while handling cascading social dynamics that unfold\nbetween multiple agents. Success requires an approach that can\nretrieve relevant events and interactions over a long period, reflect\non those memories to generalize and draw higher-level inferences,\nand apply that reasoning to create plans and reactions that both\nmake sense in the moment and in the longer-term arc of the agent\u2019s\nbehavior.\nIn this paper, we introduce generative agents \u2014agents that draw\non generative models to simulate believable human behavior\u2014anddemonstrate that they produce believable simulacra of both in-\ndividual and emergent group behavior. Generative agents draw\na wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and\ntheir environment; they create daily plans that reflect their char-\nacteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan\nwhen appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their\nenvironment or commands them in natural language. For instance,\ngenerative agents turn off the stove when they see that their break-\nfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and\nstop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to.\nA society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social\ndynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses,\nand coordination arises across agents.\nTo enable generative agents, we describe an agent architecture\nthat stores, synthesizes, and applies relevant memories to generate\nbelievable behavior using a large language model. Our architecture\ncomprises three main components. The first is the memory stream ,\na long-term memory module that records, in natural language, a\ncomprehensive list of the agent\u2019s experiences. The retrieval model\ncombines relevance, recency, and importance to surface the records\nthat are needed to inform the agent\u2019s moment-to-moment behavior.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Explain how the architecture of generative agents contributes to the emergence of social dynamics within a simulated environment, as demonstrated in the interactive society of agents inspired by games such as The Sims.\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The architecture of generative agents contributes to the emergence of social dynamics within a simulated environment through a combination of memory storage, synthesis of experiences, and planning, which together enable agents to exhibit believable human-like behavior. The memory stream component acts as a long-term memory module, recording the agents' experiences in natural language. This allows agents to have a history that informs their current and future actions.\n\nThe retrieval model within the memory stream is crucial as it determines which memories are surfaced based on relevance, recency, and importance, thus guiding the agent's moment-to-moment behavior. By selectively recalling past experiences, agents can make decisions that are contextually appropriate and reflect a continuity of character and experience, much like humans do.\n\nReflection is the second component of the architecture, which allows agents to synthesize memories and draw higher-level inferences over time. This means that agents can learn from past interactions and adjust their behavior accordingly, leading to the development of new relationships and the evolution of existing ones. Agents can also infer social norms and expectations, which further enriches the social dynamics.\n\nThe third component, planning, enables agents to translate their reflections and the current environment into high-level action plans. These plans are then broken down into detailed behaviors for action and reaction. The ability to plan and adapt plans based on new information allows for coordinated actions among agents, such as attending a party together or asking another agent on a date.\n\nAs agents interact with one another and their environment, their actions and reactions are fed back into the memory stream, influencing future behavior and contributing to a dynamic and evolving social landscape. This feedback loop creates a rich tapestry of social interactions where agents can autonomously form relationships, share information, and coordinate activities without the need for explicit scripting by developers.\n\nIn the context of the interactive society of agents inspired by games like The Sims, these architectural components enable agents to autonomously organize and participate in social events, such as a Valentine's Day party, by spreading invitations, making new acquaintances, and showing up at the right time, all stemming from a single user-generated suggestion. This demonstrates the potential for generative agents to create complex social dynamics that mimic human behavior within a simulated environment."}]}
