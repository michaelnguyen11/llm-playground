# Fine-Tuning OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo from documents
In this repository, I want to extract knowledge from the documents to create a custom dataset using GPT-4 for fine-tuning the GPT-3.5.
The aim is to distill knowledge from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5 so that a smaller GPT-3.5 becomes closer to GPT-4 performance in specific subject.

## Create the dataset
Ensure that you exported the `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable.
